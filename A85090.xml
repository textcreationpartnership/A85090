            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And whereas of late notice was ſent unto us of a Commiſſion granted by your Majeſty to the right honorable the Lord Marques of <hi>Ormond</hi> and others, authorizing them to heare what we ſhall ſay, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, and the ſame to tranſmit unto your Majeſty in writing, which your Majeſties gracious and princely favour, we find to be accompanied with theſe words; viz. (<hi>Albeit we do extreamly deteſt the odious rebellion which the recuſants of</hi> Ireland <hi>have without ground or colour raiſed againſt us, our Crown and dignity</hi>) which words, we do in all humility con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to have proceeded from the miſrepreſentations of our adverſaries; and therfore do proteſt, we have been therein maliciouſly traduced to your Majeſty, having never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any rebellious thought againſt your Majeſty, your Crown, or dignitie, but alwayes have been and ever will continue your Majeſties moſt faithfull and loyall ſubjects, and do moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty ſo to owne, and avow us, and as ſuch we preſent unto your Majeſty theſe enſuing grievances, and cauſes of the preſent diſtempers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>In primis,</hi> the Catholicks of this kingdom, whom no reward could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, no perſecution inforce to forſake that Religion profeſſed by them, and their anceſtors for thirteen hundred yeares or thereabouts, are ſince the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of the raigne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made incapable of places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or truſt in Church or Common-wealth, their Nobles become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, their Gentry debarred from learning in Vniverſities, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Schooles within this kingdome, their younger brothers put by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of imployment in their native country, and neceſſitated eyther to live
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159183:3"/>in ignorance and contempt at home, or (to their great diſcomfort and impoveriſhment of the land) to ſeek education and fortune abroad; mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes made incident to the ſaid Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> only (their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, quality, and loyalty conſidered) of all the Nations in Chriſtendome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, that by this incapacity, which in reſpect of their Religion was impoſed upon the ſaid Catholicks, men of mean condition &amp; quality, for the moſt part, were in this kingdom imployed in places of greateſt honor and truſt, who, being to begin a fortune, built it of the Ruines of the Catholick Natives, at all times lying open to be diſcountenanced, and wrought upon, and who becauſe they would ſeem to be carfull of the government) did from time to time, ſuggeſt falſ &amp; malicious matters againſt them, the ſaid Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, to render them ſuſpected &amp; odious in <hi>England;</hi> from which ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded informations &amp; their many other ill Offices, theſe miſcheifs have befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland:</hi> Firſt the oppoſitions given to all the graces, and favors of your Maieſty, or your late Royall Father promiſed or intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Natives of this Kingdom. Secondly, the procuring of falſe inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions upon fained Titles of their eſtates againſt many hundred yeares poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and no travers or petition of Right admitted thereunto, and Iurors denying to find ſuch Offices, were cenſured even to their publicke infamy, and ruine of their eſtates, the finding thereof being againſt their conſciences and cleere evidences, and nothing muſt ſtand againſt ſuch offices taken of great and conſiderable parts of the Kingdom, but Letters-patents under the great Seale, And if Letters-patents were produced, (as in moſt caſes they were) none muſt bee allowed, valid, nor yet ſought to be legally avoyded: So that of late times by the underhand working of Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> now one of your Lords-Iuſtices here, and the arbitrary illegall power of the two impeached Iudges in Parliament, and others drawne by their advice and counſell, one hundred and fifty Letters-patents were avoyded in one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which courſe continued untill all the Patents of the Kingdom, to a few, were by them and their aſſociates declared voyd, ſuch was the care thoſe miniſters had of your Maieſties great Seale, being the publick faith of the Kingdom, this way of ſervice, in ſhew only pretended for your Maieſty, proved to your diſſervice, and the immoderate and too timely advancement of the ſaid miniſters of ſtate, and their adherents, and too neere the utter mine of the ſaid Catholicks.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That whereas your Majeſties late Royall Father King <hi>James,</hi> having a princely and fatherly care of this Kingdom, was graciouſly pleaſed to grant ſeverall large and beneficiall Commiſsions under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeverall inſtructions &amp; Letters under his privie Signet, for the paſſing and ſecuring of the eſtates of his ſubjects here by Letters Patents under the great Seal, and Letters Patents accordingly were thereof paſſed, fines payed, old rents increaſed, and new rents reſerved to the Crown, And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159183:3"/>the ſaid late King was further graciouſly pleaſed, at ſeverall times to ſend divers honorable perſons of integrity, knowledge and experience, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the grievances of this kingdom, and to ſettle and eſtabliſh a courſe for redreſſe thereof. And whereas your Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed, in the fourth yeare of your raign, to vouchſafe a favourable hearing to the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances preſented unto you by agents from this kingdom, and thereupon, did grant many graces and favours unto your ſubjects thereof, for ſecurity of their eſtates, and redreſſes, or remove off thoſe heavy preſſures under which they have long groaned; which acts of Iuſtice and grace extended to this people, by your Majeſty and your ſaid Royall Father, did afford them great content, yet ſuch was, and is yet, the immortall hatred of ſome of the ſaid Miniſters of Sate, and eſpecially of the ſaid Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> the ſaid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached Iudges and their adherents; to any welfare and happineſſe of this Nation, and their ambition, to make themſelves ſtill greater and richer, by the totall ruine and extirpation of this people, that under pretence of your Majeſties ſervice the publike faith involved in thoſe grants was violated, and the grace and goodneſſe intended by two glorious Kings ſucceſſively to a faithfull people, made unprofitable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The illegall, arbitrary, and unlawfull proceedings of the ſaid Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am-Parſons,</hi> and of the ſaid impeached Iudges, and their adherents, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Court of Wards, and the many willfull erroneous decrees, and Iudgements of that Court, by which the heires of Catholick Noblemen, and other Catholicks were moſt cruelly and tyranically dealt withall, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in their eſtates, and bred in diſſolution, and ignorance, their Parents debts unſatisfied, their Siſters and younger brothers left wholy unprovided for, the Ancient and appearing Tenures of <hi>Meſne</hi> Lords unregarded, eſtates valued in Law, and made for valuable conſiderations, avoyded againſt Law, and the whole Land filled up with the frequent ſwarmes of Eſcheators, Feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, Purſevants, and others by authority of that Court.</p>

But the ſaid Lords-Iuſtices and privy counſell, obſerving that no art, or practiſe of theirs, could be powerfull to withdraw your Majeſties grace and good intentions from this people, and that the redreſſe granted of ſome principall grievances was to be paſſed, as Acts in Parliament; The ſaid Lords Iuſtices, and their adherents, with the height of malice envying the good union, long before ſetled, and continued between the Members of the houſe of Commons, and their good correſpondency with the Lords, left nothing unattempted, which might raiſe diſcord and diſunion in the ſaid houſe, and by ſome of themſelves, and ſome inſtruments of theirs in the ſaid Commons houſe, private meetings of great numbers of the ſaid houſe were appointed, of purpoſe, to raiſe diſtinction of Nation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by meanes whereof a faction was made there, which tended much to the diſquiet of the houſe, and diſturbance of your Majeſties, and the publicke ſervice.

To theſe requeſts, ſo much conducing to your Maieſties ſervice, and the ſettlement of your people, a flat denyall was given, and the ſaid Lords-Iuſtices and their party of the Counſell, by their working with their party in both houſes of Parliament, being then very thin as aforeſaid, propounded an order ſhould be conceived in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the ſaid diſcontented Gentlemen took Arms in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious manner, which was reſented much by the beſt affected of both houſes, but being awed as aforeſaid, and credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of ſome particular perſons amongſt them, ſtood in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thereunto, that the ſaid Muſquetiers were directed to ſhoot them at their going out of the Parliament houſe; through which terrour, way was given to that order.

The ſaid Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> contrary to this order, ſo wrought with his party of the Counſell, that a proclamation was publiſhed of pardon, only in two Counties, and a very ſhort day prefixed, and therein all free-holders were excepted: through which every man ſaw that the eſtates of Catholicks were firſt aimed at, and their lives next: The ſaid Lords-Iuſtices and their party having advanced their deſign thus far, and not finding the ſucceſſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their deſires, commanded Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> Knight and Baronet, deceaſed, to march to the County of <hi>Wickloe,</hi> where he burnt, killed, and deſtroyed all in his way; And in a moſt cruell manner, man, woman and child, perſons that had no appearing wills to doe hurt, nor power to execute it; ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome foot-companies did march in the night by direction of the ſaid Lords-Iuſtices, and their ſaid party, to the Town of <hi>Sawntry</hi> in <hi>Fingall,</hi> three miles off <hi>Dublin;</hi> a Country that neither then, nor for the ſpace of four or five hundred yeares before did feel what troubles were, or war meant, but it was too ſweet and too neare, and therefore fit to be forced to armes; in that town innocent husband-men, ſome of them being Catholicks, and ſome Proteſtants, taken for Catholicks, were murthered in their Inne, and their heads carried triumphant into <hi>Dublin;</hi> next morning complaint being made of this, no redreſſe was obtained therein; whereupon ſome Gentlemen of quality, and others the inhabitants of the Country, ſeeing what was then acted, and what paſſed in the ſaid laſt march towards the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p n="13">13 The ſaid Lord-Juſtices and their adherents, have againſt the fundamentall Lawes of the Land, procured the ſitting of both houſes of Parliament for ſeverall Seſſions (nine parts of ten of the naturall and genuine Members thereof being abſent) it ſtanding not with their ſafety, to come under their power, and made up a conſiderable number in the houſe of Commons, of Clerks, Souldiers, Serving-men and others, not legally, or not choſen at all, or returned, and having no manner of eſtate within the kingdom; in which ſitting, ſundry Orders were conceived, and diſmiſſe obtained of perſons before impeached of Treaſon in full Parliament, and paſſed or might have paſſed ſome Acts againſt Law, and to the prejudice of your Majeſty and this whole Nation; and during theſe troubles, Tearmes were kept, and your Majeſties Court of chief place, and other Courts ſate at <hi>Dublin,</hi> to no other end or purpoſe, but by falſe and illegall Iudgements, Outlawries, and other Capitall proceedings, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynt many thouſands of your Majeſties moſt faithfull ſubiects of this kingdom, they being never ſummoned, nor having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe proceedings, and Sheriffs made of obſcure mean perſons, by the like practiſe appointed of purpoſe, and poore Artificers, common ſouldiers, and mecanicall ſervants returned Iurors, to paſſe upon the lives and eſtates of thoſe who came in upon protection and publick faith.</p>

                  <p>Foraſmuch, Dread Soveraign, as the ſpeedy application of apt remedies unto theſe grievances and heavy preſſures, will tend to the ſettlement and improvement of your Majeſties revenue, the prevention of further effuſion of bloud, the preſervation of this kingdom from deſolation, and the content and ſatisfaction of your ſaid ſubjects, who in manifeſtation of their duty and

And for the eſtabliſhment of your people in a laſting peace and ſecurity, The ſaid Catholicks do moſt humbly pray, that your Majeſty may be further graciouſly pleaſed to call a free Parliament in this kingdom, in ſuch convenient time, as your Majeſty in your high wiſdome ſhall think fit, and the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie of the preſent affaires of the ſaid kingdom doth require; and that the ſaid Parliaments be held in an indifferent place, ſummoned by, and continued before ſome perſon or perſons of honour, and fortune, of approved faith to your Majeſty, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to your people here, and to be timely placed by your Majeſty in this government, which is moſt neceſſary for the advancement of your ſervice and preſent condition of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; in which Parliament, the ſaid Catholicks doe humbly pray theſe and other their grievances may be redreſſed, and that in the ſaid Parliament, a ſtatute made in this kingdom in the 10. yeare of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. commonly called <hi>Poynings Act,</hi> and all acts explayning or inlarging the ſame, be by a particular Act ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, during that Parliament, as it hath been already done, in the 11. yeare of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> upon occaſions of far leſſe moment then now do offer themſelves; And that your Majeſty, with the adviſe of the ſaid Parliament, will be pleaſed to take a courſe for the repealing, or further continuance of the ſaid Statutes, as may beſt conduce to the advancement of your ſervice here, and peace of this your Realme, and that no matter wherof Complaint is made in this Remonſtrance, may debarre Catholicks, or give interruption to their free votes, or ſitting in the ſaid Parliament; And as in duty bound they will ever pray for your Majeſties long and proſperous Raign over them.</p>

                     <p>Touching the fruſtrating of theſe Remonſtrants attempts to preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to Your Majeſty ſince the Rebellion began, there will appeare no truth in this ſuggeſtion, when all things are duely examined; nay it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that the Lords Iuſtices and Counſell have not concealed or debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, or any thing that came from them, to their Lords hands, but have furthered the ſame to Your Majeſties view or knowledge ſo faſt as they could: As firſt about the ſixt of November 1641. the Rebells of the County of <hi>Cavan</hi> ſent up a preſumptuous Propoſition to the Lords Iuſtices and Counſell, which their Lordſhips anſwered with all the moderation and ſatisfaction that could ſtand with their duty, as may appeare by the ſame, and forthwith certified the one and the other to the late Lord Lieutenant, to whom Your Majeſty had expreſly commanded them to ſend all addreſſes for the affaires of Ireland; after that when about the 23th. of December, 1641. certaine Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> had declared by a former Letter that they would ſtand on their guard, and after they had joyned with the Northerne Rebells in the ſiege of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> the Lords Iuſtices received a Letter from ſeven Lords of the <hi>Pale,</hi> wherein (after ſome unjuſt Challenges made to the Lords Iuſtices and Counſell) they ſignified they would not come to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:159183:11"/>them (though before they the Lords Iuſtices and Councell, had ſent them ſecurity for their perſons, and publiſhed the ſame by Proclamation) and deſired that the Lords Iuſtices and Councell, would ſend them certaine Commiſſioners to conferre concerning the Common peace, and other things. This the Lords Iuſtices and Councell thought not good to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend unto, conſidering their former great undutifullneſſe. And hereof they forthwith certified the late Lord Leiutenant alſo; but the truth is that (for ſeverall moneths in the beginning of this Rebellion) they little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded any thing the Lords Iuſtices could ſay or doe, while they hoped to carry all before them by ſurprize, or open force; And indeed untill your Majeſties Armies (by acceſſe of ſuccours ſent out of England) had redeemed ſuch of your proteſtant Subjects, as with life only eſcaped from that overwhelming deſtruction by theſe confederates prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and enabled your Majeſties diſtreſſed ſubjects to make head againſt their bloudy cruelties, and that they felt their owne weakneſſe to maintaine their diſloyalty againſt ſo potent a Monarch as your Majeſtie is; Neither indeed had they any colour of complaint, the cauſe of griefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intirely on our ſide. And at the beginning of this Rebellion they had leſſe reaſon then ever, having lately received ſo much grace. And ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in all their pretended greivances, though they had not he duty and patience to forbeare force, and humbly to reape the fruits thereof.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond overture which any of them made unto the Lords Iuſtices and Councell, was by a Letter written to the Earle of <hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi> dated the 16th of March 1641. ſigned onely by the Lords <hi>Gormonſtowne, Netterville,</hi> and <hi>Slane,</hi> in the ſtile of united Lords, wherein they deſired to have a meeting in ſome convenient place, and that in the meane time there might be a Ceſſation of Armes: This the Earle ſent to the Lords Iuſtices the 23th of the ſame moneth, which was long after the Iriſh Army was beaten from <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and that your Majeſties Army was fully Maſter of the field in all parts of the Pale, And then the Lords Iuſtices and Councell thought not fit of themſelves to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto it, but forth with certified the ſame to the then Lord Lieutenant, deſiring your Maieſties directions therein. And for their further proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the 23th of March 1642. the Lord <hi>Montgarret</hi> ſent to the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> then Lientenant Generall of your MaieſTies Army, a paper of the grievances, aſwell concerning things done in England as Ireland, and deſired it might be ſhewed to the Lords Iuſtices and Councell, that redreſſe might be given (which lay not in their Lordſhips powers) yet this alſo they ſent to the then Lord Lieutenant to be ſhewed to your Maieſtie. About Auguſt, one thouſand ſix hundred forty and two, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants ſent to the ſaid Lieutenant Generall of your Maieſties Army, a Petition directed to your Maieſtie, which his Lordſhip preſented to the Lords Iuſtices, who forthwith ſent it away to your Maieſties principall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, and ſince then no other complaint hath beene heard of except
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:159183:11"/>that Remonſtrance, and except ſome particular motions hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noned; By all which it fully appeares the Lords Iuſtices and Councell, did no way fruſtrate any of their attempts to complaine to your Maieſtie.</p>
                     <p>For the ſenſe theſe Remonſtrants ſeeme now to have of the late effuſion of innocent bloud there: Tis well if they now beginne to be ſenſible of the effuſion of the innocent bloud whereof indeed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only are guilty, which will more plainely appeare by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the times, which they cauſeleſly confound: Your Maieſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects being in full peace, and truſting only to the protection of your Maieſties lawes, theſe confederates and their bloudy inſtruments did in many parts of the Kingdome ſuddenly and treacherouſly aſſault and glut their long contealed malice, in cruelly murthering by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry kinde of tormenting deaths, ſome hundred thouſands of your Maieſties harmeleſſe Proteſtant ſubiects, and diſpoiling both them, and all the reſt of all their eſTates and ſubſtance, as is too manifeſt to the world, nothing limiting their outragious aymes, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſEd to all, extirpation of all Brittiſh and Proteſtants. All which time neither your Maieſties Governours, nor your ſurprized ſubiects were able to make any conſiderable reſiſtance: And when afterwards your Maieſties forces out of England enabled your ſubiects to ſtand upon their defence, and by your Maieſties Princely direction and authority to take due vengeance on their unparraleld wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, no man, no not the confederates in their owne conſciences can iuſtly charge your Maieſties Governours or proteſtant Subiects with bloud undeſervedly ſhed in that neceſſitated way of their own defence; and iuſt puniſhment of thoſe former heynous acts. But the confederates ought to bewayle the bloud of your Maieſties officers and ſervants fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your iuſt quarrell, as an addition of waight to their former guilt.<note place="margin">Vid.

                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas on the other ſide, aſwell your Maieſtie by your Princely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation under your royall ſignature and privy Signer, commanded them to lay downe Armes,<note place="margin">Vid.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:159183:12"/>peaceable inclination: Your Majeſties Iuſtices and Counſell did in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Rebellion give ſeverall Commiſſions to Lords and prime Gentrie of the Natives in the Pale, and all the adjacent Counties, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to gather the Forces of the Countrey, and to governe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them for preſervation of the Subjects in peace, authorizing them in thoſe Commiſſions to parley with Rebels, protect, and promiſe mercy to all that would returne to obedience; ſo much confidence had the Lords Iuſtices in thoſe old Engliſh, and did deſire to make them aſſured of their truſt: As the Lord <hi>Gormanſton</hi> in <hi>Meath,</hi> Lord <hi>Montgarret</hi> in <hi>Kilkenny, Nicholas Barnwell</hi> in <hi>Dublin, Walter Bagwell</hi> in <hi>Catherlagh,</hi> Lord of <hi>Lowth</hi> in <hi>Lowth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Nugent</hi> in <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Talbot</hi> in <hi>Wickloe,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Dillon</hi> in <hi>Longford,</hi> and ſeverall others as well in <hi>Munſter</hi> as <hi>Conaught.</hi> All which Commiſſions ſo iſſued, even to ſo many of of the Remonſtrants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were iſſued after the 23 of <hi>October,</hi> and before the laſt of <hi>November,</hi> 1641. In all which time, or afterwards, if they pleaſed, they might have ſtaid the ſpreading of the Rebellion, if promiſe of mercy could have done it, beſides ſeverall Commiſſions of Martiall Law to the Natives in each County. But they, contrary to all hope, not only forbare to protect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any, but they ſoone after joyned with the Northerne and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, to the confuſion of the State and Government, and deſtruction and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment almoſt of all Britiſh and Proteſtants: and as for thoſe few Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks who ſtood firme in loyaltie in thoſe unſeaſonable times, they have been embraced and uſed with that love and affection by your Majeſties Governours and Proteſtant ſubjects, which the Proteſtant ſubjects formerly ſhewed to them, and as the Proteſtants have been.</p>
                     <p>As to their undutifull Challenge to your Majeſties Princely and deeply merited expreſſions in your gracious Commiſſion to your ſaid Lieutenant Generall of your Army, granted in compaſſion to theſe Remonſtrants, Your Majeſties loyall ſubjects cannot obſerve their preſumption without griefe of heart, but doe in all humilitie leave the ſame to Your Majeſties moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning judgement: Your Majeſties Proteſtant ſubjects doe not beleeve, nor ever could obſerve that any of Your Governours or Proteſtant ſubjects there have either directly or collaterally in adverſe affection towards the Confederates, advertiſed againſt, or otherwiſe repreſented thoſe Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to Your ſacred Majeſtie, then the truth urged, and their bounden duty to Your Majeſtie and your ſervice preſſed them to doe.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:159183:12"/>law eſtabliſhed, and by publique Authoritie maintained in that Kingdom, then unto that Roman Catholike Religion, as they call it, which they doe now profeſſe, the free exerciſe whereof throughout that Kingdome, they by their confederacie and oath of Aſſociation are to maintain, and doe now by force authorize: And for moſt of the time after the ſaid 600 years, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion profeſſed in that Kingdome was far otherwiſe then now it is profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and practifed by theſe Confederates and ſome of their Anceſtors; for the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (which ended about the yeare 1563.) brought Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith into the Church, farre different from the former Catholique faith; And this new Religion of Popery, is the Romiſh Religion, which they call Catholike, and is now profeſſed by them. And this is the great Antiquity of theſe Romaniſts preſent profeſſion, which they fay, they and their Anceſtors have ſo long unalterably profeſſed (though that alſo in ſo large an extent is utterly untrue) for beſides what is declared in the Statute lawes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> enacted in the Reigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. and Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> expreſſing the deteſtation of thoſe Paliaments againſt the Popes uſurped authority in that Kingdome, his wreſting of Gods holy word and Teſtament to his worldly and carnall affection, and entangling and troubling the juriſdiction and Regall power, and much unquieting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, making that unlawfull which by Gods Word is lawfull, and many ſuch like expreſſions in ſeverall Statutes; which ſhewes the genius of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ireland</hi> at that time. It is cleere, that ſince the Reformation in the latter end of the Reigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8 in all the time of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the 6. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Natives of that Kingdome, Anceſtors to theſe Confederates, (howſoever perhaps in mind popiſhly affected) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ignorance of thoſe times, did generally without ſcruple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the Proteſtant Ceurches in all places where any Proteſtant Clergie could reſide, untill about the 13. yeare of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> was ſent into <hi>Ireland;</hi> And then began ſome perſons of note to ſtand at diſtance: But after that they did alſo generally come to Church both in Townes and Country, till about the 30 yeare of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> that the Spaniards, wracked upon that Coaſt, diſperſed themſelves into the Townes and ſeverall other parts, and left generally many evill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which cauſed ſome more wilfulneſſe in Recuſancie; yet after that moſt of the Natives of <hi>Ireland,</hi> all the reſidue of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reigne, (for then there were few new Engliſh) and moſt of the Reigne of King <hi>James,</hi> partly by faire inducements, and partly by the weake impulſives of the Statute of 2. <hi>Eliz.</hi> did ſtill for the moſt part, till of late yeares, come to Church, which is all that Your Majeſties Government, and Your Laws there do enjoyn them generally unto, not offering to enforce the Conſcience with torture, death, or otherwiſe, as the Romaniſts doe: Neither were they ſo unalterable in their ſuppoſed Catholique profeſſion, but that of late yeares ſeverall of them (even of noted pregnancie in the Doctrinal part) did for a Majoraltie in a City, or to ſave a penſion in ſome times, or ſome other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in others, forſake their Maſſe for that ſeaſon, to come to Church:

                     <p>Yet they were continued during their lives, howſoever afterwards none were admitted to thoſe places, but ſuch as were knowne Proteſtants, and therein the Natives of that Kingdome being ſo conditioned, were freely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, and many of them ſo dignified, as they are at this day, it being not thought fit to put that charge into the hands of Recuſants; becauſe it hath been ſince obſerved, as it is now clearely manifeſt, that they are in that Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Seedſ-men and wombe of all the diſtempers
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:159183:14"/>and miſer able ſufferings of the now deplorable Common-wealth, which is by many of conſiderable quality now lamentably acknowledged; neither indeed are the Recuſants capable of that charge by <hi>the Lawes of the Land;</hi> and if they take offence at thoſe Laws, ſupplications, not Murthers, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and depredations, were a proper way to ſue for the repeale of them; but the Nobles, (that they are become contemptible) is a ſtrange affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (they have been graced by Your Majeſty, and Your Governours from time to time, with all the reſpects of Honour and Priviledge, that is any way due to them, and in no leſſe meaſure then the Proteſtants have been; beſides it is well knowne that ſince the Proteſtant ſubjects, <hi>Brittiſh</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, became their neighbours and Tenants, and inhabited their now deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late eſtates, the Rents and Revenues of thoſe Lords were ſo raiſed, as they were brought into a condition to livel ike Noblemen in a civill Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which they were not before able to doe, nor (it is beleeved) will ever be againe, if ſome as perillouſly credulous as the Proteſtant Subiects (now ruined, have been) do not make ſuch adventures, as they have done to their coſt. Laſtly, where thoſe confederates doe boldly, and untruely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that their Gentry were debarred from Learning in Univerſities, and publique Schooles; firſt their children (though themſelves and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Papiſts) were freely admitted into all publique Schooles, as well of Your Maieſties foundation as other waies, without queſtion of Religion, wherein they attained to the knowledge of the Latine and the Greeke Tongues, and full introduction into the Arts, and all other humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And for Univerſities, they know there is but one only Colledge in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> founded by Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and endowed by Your Maieſties moſt bleſſed Father for the education of the youth of that Kingdome. That Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is of ſmal capacity, yet can it not be inſtanced, that any the ſon of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, or Gentleman were refuſed to be admitted thereunto, if they would conforme to the Lawes of the Land, and Statutes of that Society, neither are they there preſſed with the Law, till they come to be Graduates, and it is well knowne that as well from that Univerſity, as Innes of Court here in <hi>England,</hi> very many of them have gained learning and knowledge, which in many of them now is imployed to the <hi>extream annoyance and harme of Your Maieſty,</hi> and Your Kingdome, and though they were not ſo freely admitted into thoſe Societies, and in Corporations, becauſe they would not conforme to the Lawes of the Land, and Charters, Orders, and Cuſtomes of that ſociety, yet many of thoſe lived there and here with greater free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from thoſe Lawes, then the Natives of <hi>England</hi> of the Popiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did in <hi>England;</hi> and yet it is humbly conceived (that if their numbers, quality, and loyalty be rightly weighed and conſidered, there will not be found any good cauſe or found reaſons, why the Native Papiſts of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould have more freedome in <hi>Ireland,</hi> then the Native Papiſts of <hi>England</hi> have in <hi>England;</hi> and whereas they ſo needleſly preſſe for the free admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the Schoole of the Kingdome, as they have clearely received that freedome as is above mentioned (which alſo well appeares in the men of

For firſt in the 28th. yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. it was enacted that every incumbent ſhould keepe a Schoole in his Pariſh to teach Engliſh. Secondly, Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by a Statute in the 12th. yeare of her Reigne, ordained that there ſhould be a Free Schoole kept in every Dioceſſe of that Kingdome, to be maintained by her owne Clergy, and her ſenants of impropriate Parſonages and Vicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges. Thirdly, Your Maieſty, and Your Royall Father in all the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons erected many Free Schooles and endowed them. Fourthly, many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have built, and endowed Free Schooles in ſpeciall places, whereas before there were few, and thoſe only in ſome Townes, ſupported by very ſmall ſalaries; not able to give the Teachers ſubſiſtance, and ſo in a manner diſcontinued, as well appeared by the ill iteratenes, and indeed barbariſme of the people in former times; and it cannot be ſhewed that any Papiſt there has built or endowed any Schoole: nay which is worſe, all the Popiſh Clergy, and all other Popiſh Laiety, from whom that Clergy can draw any ſuch charity (much being ſo gotten) doe ſend all that can be ſo gathered to Schooles and Univerſities beyond the ſeas, whereby that Kingdome is much impoveriſhed, and the love and dependency of the people much tranſlated from Your Crowne to forraigne Princes and Potentates.</p>

                     <p>As for that ſtrange <hi>Chimera</hi> of bringing a 10000 Scots into that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to force the Catholiques thereof to change their Religion, and that <hi>Ireland</hi> would never be well without a Rebellion, to the end the Natives might be extirpated; It is little marvile that thoſe Remonſtrants in whoſe braines exterpation of Brittiſh and Proteſtants did ſo much runne, which they to their uttermoſt power ſoone after executed, &amp; had their hearts full of Rebellion, which they wickedly practiſed ſoone after, could eaſily fancy ſuch thoughts in other men, as one colour of excuſe amongſt others, for their own evill intents: But that thoſe perſons named in this Article ſhould declare or adviſe ſuch an act, to the diſturbance of that bleſſed peace, (in ſetling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have beene principall actouts) and in that Kingdome where their whole ſubſiſtance is, and where their children are matched to Natives, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo as they doe, that ſuch an action cannot be without great meanes, and authority to ſupport it, it is incredible, neither can they conceive that it will gaine more credit with any intelligent man, then the tale of wagers mentioned in this Article, the true particular whereof is, That at an Aſſizes at <hi>Wexford,</hi> a little before the Rebellion, certaine Papiſts and Proteſtants being at the Sheriffs table at dinner, a Proteſtant and a Papiſt had ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about Religion, The Proteſtant at laſt wiſhed the Papiſt to come to Church as moſt of them had done formerly whereto the Papiſt anſwered he would never go to Church, the Proteſtant ſaid I wil give you 5 l. &amp; you ſhal give me 50. l. for it, if you come not to Church before this time Twelve-Moneth, he well knowing that the Papiſt would not come to Church

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:159183:27"/>Parliament was for the generall good of the Kingdome, and your Majeſties ſervice, did willingly continue it, and gave all countenance and aſſiſtance to it, which well appeares by a motion made by a noble Peere in the Lords Houſe, That the Lords Juſtices had alwayes chearfully received their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and Meſſages, and were ready to comply with them, deſiring it might be entred, to the end it might remaine to poſteritie; It is alſo conceived that when your Majeſtie had given direction that all Letters from thence ſhould be kept apart, to the end the Committee might have recourſe unto them, if any ſuch miſrepreſentations could have appeared to them, they would have inſtanced the ſame in this Remonſtrance, and not have offered to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie ſuppoſitions for certainties.</p>
                     <p>And touching the Parliament of <hi>Irelands</hi> power of Judicature in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Capitall, there was nothing written from thence concerning that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, untill your Majeſtie being advertized of the impeachment of the Lord Chancellour, and others in the Lords Houſe, required the Lords Juſtices to ſearch and certifie, whether any preſidents might be found there for ſuch a proceeding, Your Majeſtie then alſo graciouſly declaring that as your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie intended not to prejudice the Rights of the Lords Houſe, ſo your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie did expect that they ſhould nto introduce any new preſident for that cauſe. Thereupon the Lords Juſtices having ſearched and demanded of the two Houſes of Parliament if any ſuch preſidents they could ſhew, none were produced, which the Lords Juſtices certified backe to your Majeſties prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Secretarie, as in duty they ought; And it is beleeved that thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants would not now more earneſtly preſſe for that power in Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then heretofore was done, were it not by the exerciſe, or terrour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (if their partie could have prevailed) to rid themſelves of your Majeſties Engliſh Judges and Officers, whom they cannot endure to beare rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, though they clearly ſaw the Kingdome proſpered above any former times, under their great labour and travell.</p>
                     <p>It is moſt untrue that your Majeſties Proteſtant officers or ſubjects did envy the good union betweene the two Houſes; But the truth is, they did labour to cheriſh and confirme it, by their uttermoſt skill and induſtry; And if your Majeſties ſervants, or your Proteſtant ſubjects did happen to oppoſe thoſe Remonſtrants in any their undutifull motions and projects, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning Religion, or your Majeſties Proteſtant Clergie, or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the derogation of your Majeſties Prerogatives, Rites, and authories, or malicious practiſe againſt your Majeſties Officers; Thoſe Remonſtrants did, and now doe, aſcribe it to malice againſt them and the Nation, which is a moſt unjuſt obloquie; And though your Majeſties Proteſtant ſubjects of the Commons Houſe ſaw, and knew, that there were then daily and nightly. meetings of thoſe Remonſtrants, and their party then members of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Inſomuch as it was in the former Seſſion 1641. moved in the Lords Houſe, that an order might be entred againſt ſuch meetings; And though your Majeſties Proteſtant ſubjects found that from thoſe meetings proceeded daily motions in the Commons Houſe, touching the above-mentioned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:159183:27"/>in prejudice of your Majeſty &amp; your government, whichin a manner tooke up all their time to moderate, &amp; contayn them, yet your Majeſties ſaid Proteſtant Subjects of that houſe, did for their parts forbeare any ſuch courſe of meetings, fearing to under goe ſuſpition of ſiding or inclination to diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at laſt finding the continued inconvenience of that practiſe in the Popiſh party, and hearing alſo that it was muttered amongſt many of the now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants, that they intended to impeach divers of your Majeſties principall Officers, who could not be drawne to vary from their iuſt duty to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and your rights, and againſt ſome other your Maeſties Brittiſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Officers, who had either given opinion or any waies laboured towards the clearing of your Majeſties title to the Lands in <hi>Connaught,</hi> the obſtructing &amp; fruſtrating whereof was the Remonſtrants darling care, all the reſt of their pretended greivances (both in the fourth yeare of your Majeſties raigne and thoſe lately being gathered up, and for the moſt part ſtrained out of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and ſubſervient, to countenance and ſupport the importunity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that buſineſſe, which plantation if it had proceeded, they knew would have beene a full ground of peace to that Kingdome, which they laboured to retaine from your Majeſties knowledge; Then and not till then ſome of your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects of that houſe, in theſe reſpects did only once meete, (in which meeting there were ſome Papiſts alſo) of purpoſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in ſome meaſure prepared to free themſelves and the houſe, from thoſe unreaſonable attempts, in which meeting nothing was done or agreed, that ever gave offence, or iuſt diſtaſt to the houſe, or any member thereof, which may appeare in that the Remonſtrants can mention no diſturbance thereby which they would not ſpare, if any ſuch thing they could ſpeake of, though they have not trembled to preſent to your Majeſties royall veiw, many as ſtrange inventions, neither were the Lords Juſtices ſo much as acquainted with the meeting.</p>
                     <p>It is utterly untrue that during that Seſſion of Parliament (which was very long from the 11 of <hi>May</hi> to the 7 of <hi>Auguſt</hi>) there was any certaine knowledge there, of the Committees being at the waterſide, in all which time of the Seſſion little was done to the good of the Common wealth or advancement of your Majeſties ſervice for moſt part ſpent in Proteſtations Declarations, Votes upon the queries the ſtay of ſouldiers from going over ſeas, and private petitions.</p>
                     <p>About the 14 day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1641. the Lords Juſtices finding nothing of moment for the generall good, or your Majeſties, ſervice then in doing in the houſe, ſent to both Houſes to conſider of a reaſonable time of prorogation, or adjournment of that Seſſion, the rather becauſe, the harveſt drew on, many members were gone home, and the houſe grown thyn, as in ſome orders appeares in the Lords Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Vpon the 30 of <hi>Iuly</hi> the Commons Houſe, deſired the Lords Houſe that the adjourning might be ſtaid till the ſaturday ſeavenight after, which was the 7 of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> On the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Lords houſe ordered that in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Judges were very ſhortly to goe their circuites, and ſome of them
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:159183:28"/>already licenſed, the reſt of them ſhould be that day licenſed to depart, and no more to attend that Seſſion; on the ſame day the Commons houſe ſent to the Lords HOuſe that they conceived the prorogation or adjournment was fit to be on ſaturday the 7 of that moneth, and to meete againe the ninth of <hi>November</hi> following, on the 5 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Lords Houſe ordered that a Committee of that Houſe ſhould ioyne with a Committee of the Commons (whereto the Commons Houſe alſo aſſented) to acquaint the Lords Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that both Houſes had agreed that a prorogation or adjournment ſhould be on ſaturday aforeſaid, and to meete againe on the ſaid ninth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and deſired their Lordſhips approbation thereof.</p>
                     <p>To this the Lords Juſtices anſwered them that there were three ſeverall wayes of receſſe, one by writte-of adjournment, for which no preſident was found in that Kingdome, another by adjournment to be entred in the bookes of the Houſes as done by the Lords Juſtices conſent, and the third by prorogation which their Lordſhips intended, But becauſe the Houſes enclyned to an adjournment, their Lordſhips conſented thereto, by order to be entred in the Houſes as by their conſent.</p>
                     <p>On the 6 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Lords Houſe ordered that the adjournment ſhould be on the ſatturday aforeſaid according to their reſolution ſent to the Lords Juſtices. On the ſame 6 day the Lords Houſe ordered that a Meſſage ſhould be ſent to the Commons Houſe to let them know that they ſaw no cauſe to alter their former reſolution for the adjournment, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no cauſe in the letter, that day received from the Committee in <hi>England,</hi> nor by what they otherwiſe underſtood at the late conference, and from the ſaid Earle of <hi>Roſcommon,</hi> who late then landed there, (and who brought the letter from the Committee) to expect the Bill deſired in any ſhort time, for indeed they were then at <hi>London</hi> undiſpatched, and the Letter ſaid they were then buſy about their diſpatch; And accordingly the next day being the 7 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> their Lordſhips adjourned the Houſe till the 9 of <hi>November</hi> following; All which being the very truth in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar it is hardly credible that the Lords Juſtices and their adherents (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is meant thereby) would take occaſion to uſe thoſe menacing words to ſeverall Honourable Lords in the Article mentioned <hi>(viz)</hi> that if they did not adjourne the Lords Houſe on that day being ſaturday, they would prorogueon Munday following: or whether it be likely, that by the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Lords Juſtices and ſome of the Privy Counſell, and their adherents that faction (as thoſe Remonſtrants injuriouſly tearme them) did or could in ſuch tumultuous and diſorderly manner cry out for the adjournment with purpoſe to prevent the paſſing of thoſe acts and graces, that Seſſion, which were expected from your Majeſties goodneſſe: But thoſe Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants having broken faith with your Majeſty and all your faithfull people do take liberty to aſperſe your Majeſties Governours and well affected Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. whom they deſire for ill ends to make odious to the people of both Kingdoms; And as a fatall percloſe to this Article, they ſubioyne another palpable untruth, That after the artivall of that Committee, who came not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:159183:28"/>thither till towards the end of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> That Committee could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from the Lords Juſtices Notification to be given to the Countrey of your Majeſties goodneſſe and bounty intended and ſhewed to the people, which might have tended to their great ſatisfaction; Whereas the Lords Juſtices never denyed them any ſuch thing, But <hi>De facto</hi> did forthwith write to all the Ports in the Kingdome, with briefes of thoſe graces, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matters of Cuſtomes, which that ſeaſon moſt required; Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Officers punctually to obey thoſe his Majeſties directions; They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo publiſhed Proclamations for the ſending away of Wooll, and what Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes was to be paid for the ſame; And ſent ſeverall Letters to all the Ports of the Kingdome to publiſh the ſame, And ſent warrants for free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of all Tobacco brought in, or to be brought in at all the Ports, and what Cuſtome to be paid; They gave order for drawing a Bill for repeale of the preamble of the Act of Subſidies: They alſo deſired Sir <hi>Iames Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomerie,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> two of the Committee then returned, (if they could overtake the Aſſiſes in the Counties of <hi>Vlſter</hi>) to give publicke notice to all the undertakers, what your Majeſtie had graciouſly granted and intended to them, which they undertook to doe: They had formerly ſent over the Bill for the generall pardon, which was all that for that ſhort time could be done, ſpecially the Terme, and the next Seſſion being ſo neere, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for paſſing the Acts then newly come over, as upon deliberate conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the meane time, to prepare for an orderly execution, and publication of the reſt of thoſe graces; Moſt of the reſt of the graces being to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in the Courts; The Committee alſo, and the few others of the Members of the Houſe, remaining then in <hi>Dublin,</hi> being very urgent to goe to their houſes, which they ſuddenly did: But it appeared ſoone after that thoſe Remonſtrants and their party had other intentions, and determined to be their owne carvers, aſwell of your Majeſties Rents and Subſidies then in the Collectors hands, as of all the goods ſubſtance, and eſtates of your Majeſties Brittiſh and Proteſtant ſubjects, which inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they within a few dayes after fully put in practiſe.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:159183:31"/>Catholique in that Kingdome could enjoy his eſtate, life, or liberty, if executed.</p>
                     <p>To this it is to be anſwered, that ſeverall Statutes were enacted in that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeare of that glorious Queene, And which State it is, that thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants do to much tremble at is not here underſtood; But it is beleeved that thoſe Remonſtrants pretend to find themſelves ſo much greived with the firſt Chapter of thoſe Statutes, firſt for that it was made principally to repeale the Statutes made by Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> wherein that Queene repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all Lawes made by King <hi>H.</hi> 8. againſt uſurped forraigne power, iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and authority, and to ſett up ſome other authorities and judicatures in the Church, the miſcheifs and inconvenience whereof are in that Statute of <hi>ſecundo</hi> declared, whereunto is to be added, that the continuance of ſuch a forraigne power in matters Eccleſiaſticall would utterly baniſh all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects out of that Kingdom, and leave your Majeſtie few good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there, for that the Popiſh party (being diſſolved from their iuſt depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy on your Majeſties authority in matters Eccleſiaſticall, which in true conſideration, concernes the halfe of your Majeſties Royall Soveraigne, will apply themſelves for all matters of ſpirituall cognizance, to the Pope, in whoſe power it may be to diſcharge them from alleigeance in civill cauſes, as he hath often done to other Princes, which he will not ſpare to doe, for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and to keepe on foot his old claymes. And in the ſecond place to reſtore to the Crowne the Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction which of right belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereunto, And to authorize apt Miniſters for ordering and diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, for the better eſchewing thoſe miſcheifes both to Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to revive certaine Acts repealed by Queene <hi>Mary:</hi> And for the penall part thereof againſt ſuch as ſhall maintayne and defend the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, preheminence, power or juriſdiction ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall of any forraigne Prince, Prelate, Perſon, State, or Potentate; It is to be anſwered, That that Statute is not introductive, or maketh any new cryme, for that offence was formerly Treaſon by the law, for the firſt offence; But that Statute mittigateth the ſeverity of puniſhment, and maketh it not Treaſon till the third offence committed, after the ſecond conviction and attaynder and giveth a great releife to the offendors touching the time of proſecution, ſo that the Subjects terror is leſſe then it was before: The reſidue of that law appointeth what manner of perſons ſhalbe fit for promotion in the Church, or imployment under your Majeſtie in civill affaires, and how Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries ſhall be ſued by your Majeſties Tennants, the reſtriction whereof is in your Majeſties hands to moderate at your gracious pleaſure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have of late had good experience of your princely clemency, And have little cauſe ſo to exclaime againſt your Majeſties Lawes, as deſtructive to their lives, eſtates and Liberties.</p>
                     <p>If thoſe Remonſtrants do ſo ſtartle at the ſecond Chapter of that Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, It may well be ſaid here is a great noiſe of danger, but little hurt done, and concerning theſe two Statutes, they were no ſuch concealed things for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:159183:32"/>they were printed amongſt all the Statutes of the Kingdome then printed about the 16 yeare of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> when few of thoſe Parliament men were dead, and they were put in execution ſeverally, ſoone after the Statutes were made, and long before that Queene died, as appeares by the Records extant, Only for the ſecond Chapter, it may be ſaid that it was not ſo frequently put in execution for certaine yeares after the Statute made, becauſe all men for the moſt part in that Kingdome, when there were any intervalls of peace, did come to Church though many of them went to Maſſe alſo: Recuſancy was little then heard of, or in many yeares after, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared; But when Recuſancy began over boldly to looke the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the face, and that not only, but many euill effects of Popery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be dangerous to the ſafety of the Kings Majeſties good people, and government: Then that Statute was at ſeverall times put inexecution, yet without danger to any mans life, or eſtate, neither is there any thing in that Statute that may threaten any mans life, or eſtate; the moſt binding part of that Statute, being but to ſettle and maintaine the booke of Common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and other Orders, Ornaments, and Ceremonies in the Church and Churchmen, and requires all ſubjects aſwell Proteſtants as Papiſts to come to Church every Sonday and Holy day having not lawful cauſe of abſence upon paine to forfeit 9d for every ſuch daies abſence, And that limmited to an indictment to be found at the next Seſſions or Aſſizes, after the offence committed, unleſſe men would wilfully abuſe themſelves, aſwell towards God, as the authorized Church and government. In which caſes, other penalties are appointed not reaching to life. In which Statute alſo are other favourable clauſes for the eaſe of the people farre from provoking thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants, to enter into the late hatefull conſpiracy againſt your Majeſty your Lawes, and iuſt prerogatives, or to commit ſuch outragious cruelties upon your Majeſties Brittiſh and Proteſtant ſubjects, as they have done, The ſame Lawes being now in force here in <hi>England,</hi> and much more ſharpe againſt Papiſts, and theſe Lawes in <hi>Ireland</hi> have now bin in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove foureſcore yeares, yet no man ever loſt his life or eſtate, upon either of theſe Lawes, nor Liberty for any long time, yet do thoſe Remonſtrants from this, and the other wilde fiction of 10000 Scots (then not ſo much as thought on to come thither, but long after agreed on, after your Majeſty under your owne royall ſignature had appointed and authoriſed ſeverall perſons of quality to be Collonels to proſecute Rebells and ſent upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to preſerve your Majeſties Crowne and Kingdome againſt thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats moſt unnaturall and horrid attempts) take the boldneſſe to avow the Acts of the Northerne Rebels on the 23 of <hi>October</hi> 1641 as neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto for preſervation of their Lives Liberties and Eſtates, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their religion, and for your Majeſties rights, which none there (except themſelves) ever moved or offered to oppoſe or impeach, which Northerne riſing is by Declaration made by many of themſelves in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>November</hi> 1641 and by their advice printed, profeſſed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to be a traiterous and rebellious taking up of Armes againſt your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:159183:32"/>they then ſeeming to deteſt and abhorre their abhominable and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine actions of murthers and other outrages therein, ſpecified, therein alſo proteſting to maintaine the rights of your Majeſties Crowne and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the ſaid Rebels whom they then acknowledged to be Rebels, and to fight againſt your Majeſties Rights and Government, and whom now they palliate with the attribute of diſcontented Gentlemen: Neither was that Declaration enforced from the Parliament as they ſuggeſt, but by due courſe paſſed, as well appeares by the paſſages thereof, appearing in the bookes; And in further preſumption, thoſe Remonſtrants affirme, that thoſe Northerne Traitors did ſend Declarations to the Lords Juſtices and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, humbly deſiring to be heard in Parliament; which is moſt untrue, there never comming any Declaration or other motion from any of them, to the Lords Juſtices and Counſell, other then a preſumptuous propoſition from thoſe of <hi>Cavan,</hi> which their Lordſhips anſwered, and certified to the then Lord Leivtenant as is before mentioned. Neither is it to be wondred at that theſe conſederats paſſe over ſo ſlightly the cruell murders and maſſacres act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>Vlſter</hi> and elſe where in time of full peace, (your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects not being in any poſture of defence by reaſon of the ſuddenneſſe of their ſurpriſe) conſidering the little defence the confederats are able to make againſt thoſe knowne maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres. And as to the Proclamation on the 23 of <hi>October</hi> 1641 publiſhed by the Lords Juſtices and Counſell to make knowne the preſervation of your Majeſties Caſtle and City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to publiſh the diſcovery of the conſpiracy of ſome evill affected Iriſh Papiſts, wherein all good Subjects are admoniſhed to take comfort, to ſtand one their defence and preſerve the peace; There is in that Proclamation no mention at all of any Prorogation. and whereas afterwards divers of the pale, and other old Engliſh, petitioned the Lords Juſtices and Counſell, taking offence at the words Iriſh Papiſts, wherein there being no diſtinction they might doubt themſelves involved; The Lords Juſtices and Counſell being tender leaſt they (in whoſe fidelity their Lordſhips then reſted confident) ſhould take umbrage at any their expreſſions, did by their printed Declaration dated the 29 of the ſame <hi>October,</hi> publiſh and proclaime, That by the words, Iriſh Papiſts they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the meere old Iriſh in the Province of <hi>Vlſter,</hi> and none of the old Engliſh of the Pale or other parts. True it is that on the 27 of <hi>October</hi> 1641. The Lords Juſtices by advice of the Counſell, and for the neceſſity of the time (many members of thoſe houſes being then in Rebellion, and many ſlayne or hanged, by the Rebels, and ſome impriſoned, and ſome beſeiged in their houſes by them) did proclaime a prorogation of the Parliament, from the dayes of the former adjournment in <hi>November</hi> 1641 till the 24 of <hi>February</hi> following, yet that Proclamation not to ſtand for a prorogation (as conceived not fully warranted by Law,) but was done in thoſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times to prevent concourſe at <hi>Dublin,</hi> to preſerve the members of the houſes from danger of travaile, and to the end they ſhall not be drawne from
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:159183:33"/>defence of the Country; In which Proclamation there is no word of Iriſh Papiſts, or of the Catholiques of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or of the Rebellion, raiſed, for which prorogation the Lords Juſtices received your Majeſties expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, becauſe your Majeſty <hi>deſired the Lord Leivtenant ſhould be then there,</hi> And the Lords Juſtices act was therein approved by your Majeſty as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the advice of your Counſell; And to ſhew that it was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the full prorogation when afterwards before the day of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer adjournement ſome of the houſes came to the Lords Juſtices and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and ſeeming to doubt of the legality, of that manner of prorogation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that the houſes might meete, and for clearing of all doubts might fit on the 9 day of <hi>November,</hi> and adjourne to the 16 day of that <hi>November,</hi> and at the 16 day of <hi>November</hi> might ſit for a day or two, to make ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Declaration of their loyalties, and that a ſhorter time for their next meeting then the 24 of <hi>February</hi> aforeſaid might be appointed: The Lords Juſtices and Counſell-freely-yeilded unto them in all their requeſts and on the 17 day of <hi>Nouember</hi> towards night the Parliament was prorogued in the houſes, but till the 11 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> after, though your Majeſties warrant was till the end of <hi>February;</hi> It is moſt untrue that the Lords Juſtices and Counſell limmited them, that no Acts of grace or other thing for the peoples quiet and ſatisfaction ſhould paſſe; For the houſes during thoſe two daies did make and publiſh the Declaration above mentioned, and ſome other ordinance for the proviſion, ſecurity, and comfort of the Country, as farre as might be, But they neither did, nor could then at the very beginning of of the rebellion move or offer to paſſe any acts of grace,<note place="margin">The Lords iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices by his Mjeſties dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions did make knowne to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that his Maieſty would not depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any his former favours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them for ſetling their eſtares to ſuch as ſhould remain faithfull and loyall.</note> or were denyed the ſame, many of their intentions being fixed, as ſoone after appeared, to come by their end another way, which proceedings of the Lords Juſtices and Counſell in that buſineſſe, doth appeare by Proclamation then publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Lords Juſtices and Counſell, with the privity of the houſes: And as to their being invironed with a great number of armed men in their acceſſe and receſſe to and from the houſe with their matches lighted and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skets preſented even to the breaſts of the members of both houſes: Firſt they ſhould tell that thoſe guards were put into your Majeſties Caſtle (where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none were, except the ordinary retinue of a few warders under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables Command) for guard and preſervation of the ſaid Caſtle againſt the ſaid confederats wicked plots and conſpiracies then diſcovered; And that thoſe guards did but ſtand in their Armes in the Caſtle yard, meerely as in obſervance to that eminent aſſembly of Lords and others, aſwell Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as Papiſts, and to make a guard for them in their paſſage to and from the houſe, and have held the ſame courſe ever ſince, when thoſe houſes have conſiſted in a manner wholly of Proteſtants, and all done without any intent or deſigne to offend affront, or terrify any of them, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants did, and do well know if they would deale ſincerely in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And certainly any of the members of either houſe then preſent could not from ſuch a civility rendred to them, take up the leaſt apprehenſion
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:159183:33"/>of terror in ſome inward guilt, did not beget in them a feare or jealouſie of what was never intended or thought of: The ſame courſe for ornament being held by the late Lord Leivtenant the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Parliament, and by the now Lord Lievtenant at the laſt Seſſion.</p>
                     <p>Neither did any thing then hinder the Lords Juſtices from ſeizing on their perſons, if they had beene willing to take ſtrong preſumptions and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of guilt, for a ground againſt men, whom indeed they deſired to thinke better of, and hoped they would employ themſelves better for your Majeſties ſervice: It is alſo an untruth that the Lords Juſtices, and their partie of the Counſell (what is meant by that partie is not underſtood) for there was not ſo much as a ſhadow of any partaking or ſiding there in any matter; But the Lords Juſtices, and Counſell unanimouſly concurred in all things, did cauſe an order to be propounded in the Parliament to declare; That the Iriſh had taken up Armes in rebellious manner; For the Lords Juſtices and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell did not conceive that there was any neceſſity for their atteſtation, ſo that too well knowne a truth the bleeding teſtimonies of many miſerable ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, men, women and children unable to reſiſt, who eſcaped thoſe curſed blood-ſuckers in <hi>Vlſter</hi> daily comming to the Citie of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to other Garriſons, ſtripped, robbed, wounded, and ſpoiled, then gave ſufficient evidence of then Rebellious and tyrannous acts: But the truth is, the ſitting was permitted two dayes at their owne ſuite, as appeares by Proclamation after publiſhed; That they might draw up ſome Declaration of their owne loy alties, as they ſaid, and their deteſtation of the abominable acts of the Rebells; yet ſeeing they have the confidence to move in that paſſage ſiniſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to your Majeſtie your Royall Majeſtie may pleaſe to know, that when the Houſes had appointed certaine Committees to draw up that Ordinance, and thoſe Committees had dutifully expreſſed thoſe Rebells by the juſt tearmes of Traitours and Rebels; Many of theſe Remonſtrants then of the Houſe much conteſted it, and would not have them ſo called, being privie to what themſelves had formerly with thoſe Rebells contrived to be done, and fearing it might move the Rebells to recriminate, Howſoever the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paſſed by Votes, and was agreed on; But that any ſuch menaces to ſuch as ſhould oppoſe that Declaration were by any man uttered (though they ſay it is a thing that was credibly informed) is a moſt falſe ſcandall, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Houſes ſhewing plainly, that it was done in the Houſes, no way urged or enforced upon them.</p>
                     <p>There were never any ſuch provocations, preſſures, and indignities, as in this Article are mentioned, offered to the conſiderable partie of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; And although the Remonſtrants ſay, That at the time of that Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all the Cities and Corporations, and whole Provinces ſtood quiet, yet at the apprehenſion of <hi>Hugh Mac Mahon</hi> on the 23. of <hi>October</hi> aforeſaid; The ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> being demanded by the Lords Juſtices, and Counſell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thought (that though they had taken <hi>Dublin</hi>) the reſt of the ſtrong Townes in the Kingdome, which were the Kings, would yeeld to them, he

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:159183:34"/>were kept in Bodyes, the one in <hi>Munſter,</hi> not farre from <hi>Kinſale,</hi> another in <hi>Connaught</hi> towards <hi>Gallway,</hi> and the third in <hi>Leinſter</hi> about <hi>Dublin,</hi> and thoſe parts, when the Caſtle and Citie of <hi>Dublin</hi> was preſerved, there was a generall change in all former Counſells, yet afterwards the ſaid <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rett Barry,</hi> and all his men went into Rebellion, and ſo did moſt of the ſouldiers, and officers of the other two Regiments; Beſides, on the twenty third day of <hi>October</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred forty one, The Rebells in <hi>Vlſter.</hi> when they ſpoiled and murthered the Engliſh, ſaid with one voyce, that <hi>Dublin</hi> was taken; Alſo are to bee remembred, the ſeverall Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to this Rebellion, aſwell in print as in words uttered by Romiſh Clergie men, and ſome Laicks, that within three yeares, a generall Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſhould be in <hi>Ireland,</hi> mentioned in the printed Depoſition of Doctor <hi>Iones;</hi> And in the moneth of <hi>October,</hi> before the execution of this Plott.

It appeares alſo by examinations ſent up by the late Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> in the beginning of this Rebellion, that about the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three of <hi>October</hi> 1641. the taking of the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and other your Majeſties Forts in <hi>Vlſter,</hi> &amp;c. was then muttered in that Province, (for a while after in ſhew quiet.) And the like in <hi>Connaught,</hi> though at that time, neither of thoſe had heard any thing of the diſcovery from <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> nor many dayes after; By all which is ſomewhat plaine, That the Conſpiracy was generall, and that the three Provinces ſtood not ſo cleare, and quiet in <hi>November,</hi> as in this Article is inſinuated; The Remonſtrants being carefull to leave nothing unobjected, that malice or Art can invent. doe ſuggeſt, that the Lords Juſtices and their adherents (who thoſe were is not yet knowne) well knowing that many powerfull members of the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> ſtood in oppoſition to your Majeſtie, made their principall addreſſes to them full fraught with calumnies againſt thoſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; Firſt, it is conceived that there was no ſuch oppoſition given to your Majeſtie, as in the Article is mentioned, when this Rebellion began, your Majeſty being then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> beſtowing your Grace and Royall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence on your Subjects there: Neither at that time was any difference heard there betweene your Majeſty and your Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> ſave what concerned the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> whom the Remonſtrants moſt violently
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:159183:35"/>proſecuted; Secondly, the Lords Juſtices and Counſell did firſt addreſſe their advertiſement of this Rebellion, not to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as the Remonſtrants pretend, but to your Majeſtie on the twentie five of <hi>October</hi> 1641. And to your Majeſties then Lievtenant of that Kingdome, to whom all addreſſes thence were to bee made by your Majeſties Order. A Copie of which Letters to the Lord Lievtenant, they then ſent to your Majeſty and by the anſwer of that diſpatch they were advertiſed that your Majeſty had ſent to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> concerning that affaire, and that your Majeſty doubted not of their ſpeedy reſolution for releife of your Majeſties faithfull Subjects: The next diſpatch ſent away by the Lords Juſtices and Counſell into <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> was on the fift of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1641 at which time they directed letters to the Lords of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties privy Counſell in <hi>England,</hi> and conſidering that your Majeſty was then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that it then became of abſolute neceſſity to invoke all the powers, that might ſtand with your Majeſties honour, and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, from whom any deliverance could come, to aſſiſt for preſervation of your Majeſties Crowne and Kingdome; They then alſo, and not before, directed letters to the ſpeakers of both houſes of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> referring the particulars to the Lords of the Counſells letters, and moving for ſuccours, and then alſo they ſent a diſpatch to your Majeſty into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and encloſed therein copies of their ſeverall letters to the Lords of the Counſell and both the Speakers, and then alſo ſignified by their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Lords of the Counfell that they had ſo written to both the Speakers.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:159183:35"/>of thoſe truſted with them, were recovered and brought backe, and the reſt ſoone after imployed by the confederats to fight againſt your Majeſtie and your Armyes: And for the Cotholiques in the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> of whoſe ancient fidelity (in the beginning of this Rebellion) the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices and Counſell were fully perſwaded; they were not diſarmed, till moſt of the Catholiques of the Pale declared themſelves in open Rebellion againſt your Majeſtie, which the Lords Juſtices and Counſell finding and conſidering that thoſe Inhabitants of <hi>Dublin</hi> were for the moſt part allied &amp; matched with the gentry and conſiderable Inhabitants of the Pale, That ſome of them ſent daily intelligence to the Rebels, ſent them proviſions of victualls and otherwayes and ſundry of them of good ſubſtance, went to the Rebels with their goods, That great numbers of the Popiſh prentizes ſervants, and Iournymen of the City went daily to the Rebels and joyned with them, and that daily rumours were ſpread in the City, aſwell by words, as by papers ſcattered and found, that ſurpriſes and maſſacres were intended againſt your Majeſties Subjects the Proteſtants of the City, then was it thought fit, and not before, to diſarme thoſe Catholiques the better to ſecure the City for your Majeſty, and quiet the Catholiques who might well know that the ſtrength of the Proteſtants was their ſecurity, and from which Proteſtants, the Catholiques never found any violence offered (the Proteſtants profeſſion abhorring ſuch wickedneſſe) the Lords Juſtices and Counſell alſo ſent armes and powder to <hi>Drogheda;</hi> delivered armes and powder for zoo men to <hi>Wexford</hi> they ſent powder to <hi>Waterford,</hi> and gave them licence to buy and import, powder and armes for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, though afterwards when they ioyned in the Rebellion the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Counſell reſtrained it as much as they could. They ſent powder to <hi>Trym,</hi> they ſent powder for <hi>Dondalke</hi> as far as <hi>Drogheda,</hi> where it was ſtaid becauſe <hi>Dondalk</hi> was yeilded up to the Rebels before it could come thither, they alſo wrote letters to the ſeverall Townes of <hi>Wexford, Waterford, Gallway</hi> and <hi>Drogheda</hi> commending their then ſeeming forward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and encouraging and perſwading to ſtand conſtantly in duty, and faith to your Majeſtie their Lord and King: It is true that the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices and Counſell received an order of both houſes of Parliament in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whereby they did commend to the Lord Leivtenant or in his abſence to the Lord Deputy, or Lords Juſtices according to the power of their Commiſſion to beſtow your Majeſties gracious pardon to all ſuch as were ſeduced on falſe grounds, and within a convenient time to be declared by their Lordſhips, ſhould returne to their due obedience: This Order the Lords Juſtices and Counſell printed at <hi>Dublin</hi> forthwith after receipt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the 12 of <hi>November</hi> 1641 and diſperſed it into all parts of the Kingdom, as farre as they could to try whether it might worke any relenting or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of thoſe confederated Catholiques, to the Lords Juſtices and Counſell to the end they might have further proceeded, to have obtevned a more full direction for granting pardon, if that could have beene likely
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:159183:36"/>to reclaime any of them: The Lords Juſtices alſo found in their Commiſſion and inſtructions, no expreſſe warrant to pardon ſuch pernitious Traitours, and that in all late former pardons, Treaſons againſt your Majeſty and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was excepted, and they daily expected the old Levitenants comming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with more ample authority, and direction, and conſidered alſo that on the 30 of <hi>October</hi> before the Lords Juſtices and Counſell had by publique Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation adventured ſo farre as to tender your Majeſties grace to all ſeduced Rebels whereupon none then tendred themſelves to the Lords Juſtices and Counſell, or any other your Majeſties Officers, and afterwards on the firſt day of <hi>November</hi> 1641 the Lords Juſtices and Councell foreſeeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that the Inhabitants of <hi>Meath, Lungford, Weſtmeath</hi> and <hi>Lowth,</hi> who of the Pale lay next to the Northerne Rebels, might be firſt educed, either by ſtrange rumours ſpread abroad, or by the falſe enticement of the Clergy, and deſirous to contayne and preſerve as many of them as they could, did by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Proclamation (adviſed and drawne by Mr. <hi>Plunket</hi> and others of the Commons houſe) admoniſh all that were not Freeholders, nor having their hands in blood, within ten dayes to ſubmit themſelves before any Juſtice of Peace or cheif Officer of a Corporation, and reſtore the Proteſtants goods which they had taken, &amp; thereupon they ſhould be received to mercy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a few ſubmitted in the County of <hi>Meath</hi> but never reſtored any thing, nor proceeded further to give ſatisfaction of their loyalty, but ſoone after returned to their former defection and ioyned in the ſaid Rebellion; All which adviſedly conſidered the Lords Juſtices and Counſell thought not fit to proſtitute your Majeſties royall grace to men ſo ungratefull and deper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for they plainly ſaw, that the confederacy and their perſwaſion to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all by force was ſo ſtrong, as their actions gave no hope of any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſubmit themſelves to your Majeſties grace and mercy; No not when your Majeſties Proclamation under your royall Signature, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſignet was ſent amongſt them; Commanding them to lay downe Arms, nor untill they of the Pale, and the Iriſh of <hi>Vlſter</hi> were beaten from <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheda,</hi> and the ſeige wholly raiſed which was about the beginning of <hi>March</hi> and that your Majeſties Levitenant Generall of your army, was in the feild with a ſtrong force of foote and horſe, able to <hi>March</hi> where he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in <hi>Meath, Lowth,</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> ready to burne and deſtroy their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and eize on the former owners thereof, if they could be found; Then and not till then ſome, and thoſe but very few of <hi>Meath</hi> rendred themſelves to the Leivtenant Generall of your Majeſties army who received them as priſoners, and a few others of that County rendred themſelves at <hi>Dublin</hi> who were all impriſoned as was juſt, to ſo notorious and obſtinate offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, And it were criminall in the Lords Juſtices and Counſell not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them. Neither did the Lords Juſtices and Counſell ayme at any of their eſtates, but on the contrary alwayes ſhewed much regret, at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall defection of the pale, which had for the moſt part in other Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtood firme and loyall: And certainly they would have beene moſt glad
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:159183:36"/>to have preſerved as many of them as they could, as well appeared in their readineſſe to embrace the Earle of <hi>Weſtmeath</hi> and his Familie, upon timely application made, though the Lords Juſtices and Counſell had Intelligence of Northerne Rebells reſorting to his houſe: They alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sir <hi>Morgan Cavanaghs</hi> falſe and feigned Proteſtations permitted him to returne to his houſe, in hope of his good obedience, though they had cauſe to ſuſpect his and hsi ſonnes comming to the Towne on the 22. of <hi>October</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred fourty one. They permitted Sir <hi>Luke Fitzgerald</hi> to depart quietly, becauſe he came to them ſoone after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Rebellion, though the Proteſtant Tenants dwelling on his land, were deſpoiled of all their ſubſtance, not without his privitie, as ſince hath appeared: They permitted <hi>Robert Harpoole</hi> of <hi>Frowle,</hi> and necre <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlogh,</hi> to depart upon his faire proteſtations, notwithſtanding they had intelligence of his former being with the Rebells; The Sheriffe of <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and others of the <hi>Offarralls</hi> permitted backe againe, though informed to have joyned in pillaging of the Proteſtants, and many others in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe the Lords Juſtices thought fit to forbeare all manner of ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at firſt, hoping they would not ſo farre forget their duties, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they all did, and alſo divers others about <hi>Dublin</hi> (who entertained Rebells (ſome perhaps of neceſſity) were permitted to be at libertie by the Lords Juſtices, becauſe they deſired to retaine as many of them as they could, comming in any time, before they had openly joyned with the Rebells, and committed the horrible acts of hoſtilitie, which put them out of the Lords Juſtices power to receive them, without further allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and direction from your Majeſtie, which they writ for, and deſired to receive.</p>
                     <p>Touching Sir <hi>Charles Cootes</hi> journey into <hi>Wickloe,</hi> who with ſuch a ſmall force of Engliſh and Iriſh, as the Lords Juſtices and Counſell could then raiſe, ſet forth from <hi>Dublin</hi> on the 27. of <hi>November</hi> 1641. the deſigne being to relieve your Majeſties Caſtle of <hi>Wickloe,</hi> and one other only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle kept by a ſubject, but both beſieged by Rebells: All the Iriſh of that Countie having many dayes before riſen in open Rebellion, ſurprized your Majeſties Fort of <hi>Cairis</hi> Fort, <hi>Arckloe</hi> Fort, <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and all the houſes of the Engliſh in that Countie, The Lord <hi>Eſmonds</hi> houſe, and the adjacent parts of <hi>Wexford,</hi> robbed all the Brittiſh Proteſtants, threatned to aſſault <hi>Dublin,</hi> having robbed and preyed within two miles thereunto, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all amnner of acts of hoſtility, as is before particularized: Hee had alſo direction to kill and ſpoile by fire and ſword thoſe Iriſh Rebells, ſo farre as he could; But it is not true that any there dicd by his command, ſave one woman one whoſe backe, certaine of the Proteſtants ſpoyles were found, and twelve or thirteene men, who were proved to have committed the ſame rebellious acts, and ſuch as fought with him in open field, with Banners diſplayed, where the Rebells being, as hee conceived a thouſand
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:159183:37"/>ſtrong, were by him routed, and put to flight; Neither could that journey any way terrifie thoſe of the <hi>Pale,</hi> or give them occaſion of ſuſpition of any violence intended againſt them, being principally intended to prevent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions and ſpoyles of the Iriſh to bee committed on them as they had in former times often done: and againſt whom they had with much effuſion of blood, often defended themſelves: yet now ſo plainely appeares their preceded generall conſpiracie in this Rebellion, as they are not abaſhed, (deſpiſing the honour of their birth, and loyaltie to your Majeſtie) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſence of thoſe Rebells ſufferings, and to mention your Majeſties juſt vengeance taken on thoſe antient, and in all former, and later ages, and now declared Rebells and Traitours, as one of their motives to take up Armes, or at leaſt to ſtand on their guard, as they call it: Touching the Act of <hi>Santry</hi> three miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſeeming to worke ſo much upon the Remonſtrants, as to put them into open rebellion againſt your Majeſtie, as if they could reſolve of a generall Rebellion in all the Kingdome in twentie foure houres; It is fit to open the truth of this ſuppoſed fearfull, and as may be ſaid miraculous accident, being of force almoſt to raiſe a whole County into Armes in one day againſt your Majeſtie, and your peaceable ſubjects; though the ſaid County (during ſix weekes after the conſpiracie againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the ſtate, was diſcovered and prevented) did not ſeeme able (or rather being unwilling) by all faire perſwaſions of the Lords Juſtices and Counſell uſed to them, to put themſelves into a poſture of defence, againſt the Rebells of <hi>Vlſter,</hi> to find any Armes to arme their men, or agree upon Captaines to command them, notwithſtanding they had upon the twenty two of <hi>November</hi> after ſeverall invitations thereunto received out of your Majeſties ſtores, Armes, and all other Munition for three hundred men; And not withſtanding that the Lords Juſtices and Councell in <hi>October</hi> 1641. wrote Letters to the ſeverall Counties of the Pale to name their Captaines, gather their men, and fetch out their Armes, which they deferred, ſometimes ſeeming deſirous to have all things agreed on in Parliament, which they knew could not then meet, and ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other pretences: And notwithſtanding that they ſaw the inferiour peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe Counties formerly to riſe in multitudes to murther, rob and ſpoile, the Brittiſh and Proteſtant Inhabitants amongſt them, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance or controll; And in particular they had murthered <hi>Derrick Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> a Proteſtant Gentleman in his owne houſe, and ſome others of his familie in the County of <hi>Dublin;</hi> And about ten miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other ſo uſed in other parts, and had ſpoyled Proteſtants in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Villages within three or foure miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in <hi>Fingall,</hi> where the Remonſtrants doe ſay the Inhabitants had felt no warres or troubles for foure hundred yeares before, yet could <hi>Luke Nettervile,</hi> ſonne to the Lord <hi>Nettervile,</hi> who dwelt but ſeven miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> in that County of <hi>Fingall,</hi> and the other Gentrie of that County Arme and Muſter at <hi>Swoards</hi> (about ſix miles from <hi>Dublin</hi> (about twelve hundred men on the

And in part of <hi>November</hi> before, many of the inferiour Inhabitants, and ſome of the Gentry, made the like ſpoile of the Britiſh and Proteſtants in the County of <hi>Kildare:</hi> About the ſame time, very many of the old En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and Iriſh, were in rebellion about <hi>Roſſe</hi> and <hi>Wexford,</hi> in the County of <hi>Wexford:</hi> Before this time alſo they had publike Maſſe in many Churches in the Counties of <hi>Meath</hi> and <hi>Dublin:</hi> And about the 27 of <hi>November</hi> aforeſaid, the walled Towne of <hi>Trym,</hi> in the heart of <hi>Meath,</hi> was ſeized on by the Rebels, and many of your Majeſties Subjects mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered there: About the beginning of that December, were the Britiſh and Proteſtants in the County of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> robbed and ſpoiled by the Gentry, and Iriſh Inhabitants, Papiſts of that County: and in the ſame moneth, the Lord <hi>Mountgarret</hi> having drawne a ſtrength of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Armed into the City of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> ſtood by, while the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh there dwelling, and ſuch as came thither for ſafety were ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and pillaged: On the 1 and 2 day of December aforeſaid, the Northerne Rebells in great numbers were lodged and entertained in the ſtrong Caſtle and Village of <hi>Platten</hi> in <hi>Meath,</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Boyne,</hi> about two miles from <hi>Drogheda,</hi> belonging to <hi>Nicholas Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> Eſquire: About the laſt of November, or the firſt of December aforeſaid, the Northern Rebels, and thoſe of the <hi>Lowth,</hi> and <hi>Meath</hi> in the <hi>Pale</hi> who aſſiſted them, were ſet downe in Leaguer round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Drogheda,</hi> on both ſides the River; againſt whom the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Meath</hi> or <hi>Dublin</hi> made no manner of reſiſtance: About the 4 day of the ſame <hi>Dublin</hi> met with the Northerne Rebels at the Hill of <hi>Crofty al' Grofty,</hi> not farre from <hi>Drogheda;</hi> the manner of

It is alſo teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that certaine dayes before this generall meeting, divers prime Gentry of <hi>Meath,</hi> and the chiefe Officers of the Rebels, had a meeting at <hi>Duleeke,</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Boyne</hi> in <hi>Meath;</hi> and that a few dayes after this meeting at <hi>Crofty</hi> aforeſaid, all the Lords and Gentry of <hi>Meath,</hi> and divers of the Northerne Rebells had another meeting at the Hill of <hi>Taragh</hi> in <hi>Meath,</hi> where they determined on the maintenance of the Northerne Rebells, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Siege, and what proviſion of Beeves and Corne ſhould bee raiſed on the Country, for every hundred of the ſaid Rebels, which was done accordingly by their Warrants; the Sheriffe of that County called <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Dowdall</hi> (who was with them in Rebellion) obeying them in all things. And ſoon after another meeting, the ſaid Lords and Gentry made choice of new Generals of Foot and Horſe, and other Officers of the Field, and Captaines in that County, and appointed who ſhould be chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in each Barony, and what number of men ſhould bee raiſed and maintained out of each Plow land in that County of <hi>Meath,</hi> aſwell to joine in the Siege, as to fight with any other your Majeſties Armies, which were conceived to amount to two thouſand men; whereas in ſix weekes before, at the inſtance of the Lords Juſtices, and Councell, they could or would not raiſe five hundred men for the defence of the County againſt the Rebells, which with ſeeming great forwardneſſE they at firſt promiſed to doe; and for whom five hundred Armes with Munition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable was appointed by the Lords Juſtices, and Councell, and the Armes ſent as farre as <hi>Gormanſton,</hi> and there kept till upon notice of the Rebells comming into the Countrey, the Lords Juſtices, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, ſuddenly convaied them to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> which the Lord of <hi>Gorman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> pretends to be done by his monition: Though the truth is, the Lords Juſtices had that morning, before hee declared it, ſent away to have it done that night, otherwiſe they had been taken, and hee thinking that the Lords Juſtices, and Councel could not ſo ſoon remove them, and preſuming beſides (in caſe they were ſo removed) to have them within a few dayes in <hi>Drogheda</hi> (whether hee moved they might bee convayed) by taking that Towne, whereof hee little doubted: About the beginning of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>

All which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are here ſpecified, together with the times of each action (as many others might bee mentioned) to the end that it appearing in what eaſe the <hi>Pale,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Leinſter</hi> ſtood, before the killing at <hi>Santry,</hi> and burning at <hi>Clantarfe,</hi> your Majeſtie may the more clearly ſee the vanity and malignity of the Confederates, in pretending to be terrified into Armes by thoſe acts (which they well know were ſubſequent to their taking Armes) and by their other deviſed Provocations in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> no truer then the former. And it is obſervable, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Remonſtrance, they in expreſſe and plaine termes doe affirme that they at firſt, were neceſſitated to take Armes for preſervation of their Religion, the maintenance of your Majeſties Rights and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and defence of their Lives, Eſtates, and Liberties, of the danger whereof there was not then ſo much as a ſhadow, beſide their generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowment of their acts in <hi>

The Lord Preſident rather blamed the Lords Juſtices and Councell for their milde courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Rebels of other parts, not thinking the Conſpiracy to bee ſuch as they found it, and thinking a ſharpe perſecution would ſoon quell it, wherein hee both miſtook their generall combination (which hee after found) and the Lords Juſtices inability to ſet upon it with that vigour that had been requiſite: The Lords Juſtices and Councell alſo ſent him directions to authorize prime men in each County to Command the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the County, and ſent him Commiſſions for martiall Law to bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to men of quality of the Natives, and others of purpoſe to ſettle the peace of the Country, and prevent rebellion if it might bee.</p>
                     <p>The firſt occaſion that neceſſitated him to uſe force, was about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>December,</hi> 1641. when the Rebells of <hi>Wexford, Kilkenny,</hi> and <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlagh</hi> came over the River, to prey and ſpoile in the County of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> before mentioned, whither he made haſt to encounter them, and whom, though he was farre inferiour in number, he diſcomfited, and ſlew many of them, and executed others, and recovered much of the ſpoile, which he cauſed to be reſtored to the owners: In this action he found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Provincialls, to whom hee ſuffered no hurt to bee done, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they came thither for ſaving their goods, not then beleeving the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to bee ſuch, as ſoon after hee found it. The ſecond diſturbance which hee heard of, was in the County of <hi>Tipperary,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Purcell,</hi> called the Baron of <hi>Loghmo,</hi> had ſtirred, and ſet on the Iriſh in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to rob and ſpoile the Britiſh, and Proteſtants, which they arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did; thither he went the ninth of <hi>December</hi> aforeſaid, with ſuch ſmall forces of the Engliſh, as he then had (for hee then wrote he found cauſe to truſt very few Papiſts) and there finding where the ſpoiles were made, he purſued therebels, and ſuch as he found in the act, and the Proteſtants Cattle in their hands, he ſlew, and executed and burnt two or three Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, hoping by that quick courſe to ſtay and terrifie others; There hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued great ſtore of Cattle of all ſorts to the owners; ſoon after did the Inhabitants of all ſorts riſe into rebellion in ſeverall parts of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and before the end of that <hi>December</hi> did all the Iriſh and Old Engliſh Papiſts in the County of <hi>Tipperary,</hi> and <hi>Limberick</hi> forſake their Allegiance, and with them joyned many prime men and others our of <hi>Oſtery,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and murthered, ſpoiled and ranſacked all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and Proteſtants upon theſe extremities; he had by warrant of the Lords Juſtices and Councell raiſed a thouſand Foot and ſome Troopes of Horſe, but wanted Armes for moſt of them, which the Lords Juſtices were not able to furniſh (having delivered to the Lords and Gentry of the <hi>Pale,</hi> and others in <hi>Leinſter</hi> for their defence, as many as poſſibly could be ſpared) ſo as he was in a very ill condition, till ſome forces arrived there out of <hi>England,</hi>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:159183:44"/>which was in <hi>February,</hi> 1641. And then, and not before did the Lords Juſtices and Councell require the Lord Preſident to proſecute thoſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Rebels with fire and ſword (as was fit) ſo farre as he was able: The Rebellion afterwards increaſed upon him in all parts, and when about the end of <hi>February</hi> he publiſhed and ſhewed to ſo many prime men as he could, your Majeſties gracious Proclamation, under your Royall ſignature and Privie Signet, for laying downe Armes, they rejected it, ſome ſaying it was counterfeit, others, that it was done by coertion. By all which fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, both that noble Gentlemans moderation, and the Lords Juſtices and Councels avoiding all unjuſt Provocation, at leaſt that they were not ſet upon thoſe wayes of unreaſonable cruelty, unjuſtly charged on them by the Remonſtrance, and that thoſe Inhabitants were not forced to ſtand on their defence, his caſe being onely to defend himſelfe againſt them if he could, which with great hazzard of himſelfe, and your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties affaires in that Province he was driven unto, conſidering his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in men, and other meanes, and their exceſſive numbers, rebelliouſly gathered together, and armed by a long Proviſion underhand, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the wealth of all the Britiſh, and Proteſtants, being very great in that Province, which they ſuddenly and traiterouſly ſeized upon. Touching <hi>Connaught</hi> the report muſt bee farre different from that of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> although the Remonſtrants ſay it was uſed in the like meaſure, which ſhewes that they are the ſame in bold affirmation, howſoever the probability or caſe differeth: When this Rebellion began, the Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of that Province was in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſaw the moderate and winning courſe uſed, and intended towards thoſe of the <hi>Pale</hi> and <hi>Leinſter,</hi> by the Lords Juſtices and Councell, about the beginning of <hi>November</hi> following, hee went towards <hi>Connaught,</hi> where at his comming to <hi>Athlone,</hi> hee found much diſorder in the Province, hee found very many of the inferiour <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and ſome of the Gentry in rebellion, in the Counties of <hi>Roſcomon,</hi> and <hi>Sligo,</hi> and that they had murthered, robbed, and ſpoiled the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants dwelling among them; hee entred into a faire courſe of Treaty and perſwaſion with the prime men of the ſeverall Counties not then in rebellion, preſuming in ſome alliance, and former private friendſhip and intereſt amongſt them, which prevailed little, as hee after found: Hee had no ſtrength to reſiſt them, there being but one Troope and a halfe of Horſe (moſt <hi>Iriſh</hi>) in the Province, whereof hee could make little or no uſe: And ſix halfe Companies of Foot, whereof one was ſurprized, and loſt their Armes, and one drawn away to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the reſt ſo diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ingaged in <hi>Leytrim,</hi> then totally in Rebellion, as hee could make little or no uſe of them: by which appeares, hee was in no caſe to uſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty againſt the people, or put them to defence, nor ſo much as reſcue the poore <hi>Britiſh</hi> and Proteſtants in their goods out of the hands of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Rebelst neither were the Proteſtant Inhabitants of that Province any way able to defend themſelves, being not armed, againſt ſuch ſwarmes as aſſaulted them: The Lords Juſtices, and Councell ſent down Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:159183:44"/>of government, to the prime Natives in the ſeverall Counties, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> to the Lord of <hi>Mayo,</hi> Lord of <hi>Coſtilo,</hi> and others, and Commiſſions of Martiall Law to other Natives of beſt choyce, of purpoſe to prevent diſturbance as much as might bee, and to ſtay the people: But ſo little prevailed all the Lord Preſidents lenity, and ſwaſory courſes, and the care of the Lords Juſtices and Councell, to avoid any offence, or rigid uſage towards them; as within the Moneth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> moſt of the prime men of the Province declared themſelves Rebels and of the Conſpiracy; They blocked him up in the Caſtle of <hi>Athlone</hi> by the helpe of the Conſpirators of <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> They burnt his Towne of <hi>Roſcomon,</hi> and the Biſhops Towne of <hi>Elphin,</hi> and many other <hi>Engliſh</hi> mens habitations, They ſurprized ſeverall Caſtles of the Earle of <hi>Clonrickards,</hi> in the County of <hi>Galway;</hi> notwithſtanding that on their ſurmiſe that they doubted they ſhould not have the benefit of the graces, his Lordſhip wrote to your Majeſtie, and received aſſurance in their behalfes of the ſame, which he publiſhed, together with ſeverall other Declarations of your Majeſties. And ſo the Lord Preſident continued in <hi>Athlone</hi> till your Majeſties Lieutenant Generall of your Army, carryed downe 2000. foot, and ſome Troopes of horſe: by all which appeares, that neither the Lords Juſtices, and Councell, nor the Lord Preſident, nor any other in that Province did any thing to provoke them, much leſſe to put them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, till they had murthered, robbed and ſpoyled all the Brittiſh and Proteſtants, and committed all other Rebellious and hoſtile Acts that lay within their luſt or power.</p>

On the 23 of <hi>October</hi> 1641. when the houre approached, which was deſigned for ſurprizing your Majeſties Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> great numbers of ſtrangers were obſerved to come to towne in great parties ſeverall wayes, who not finding admittance at the gates, ſtayed in the Suburbs and fields, and there grew numerous, to the terrour of the Inhabitants; Inſomuch
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:159183:45"/>as the Magiſtrates of the City came to the Councell board, with much feare and aſtoniſhment, declaring that thoſe mighty numbers in the fields and Suburbs, ſtill increaſing, did threaten high &amp; preſent danger, in reſpect whereof, and conſidering the great numbers of deſperate and looſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were the night before, and that morning, ſtolne into the City and Suburbs, from ſeverall parts of the Kingdome, who were ſecretly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored amongſt the Papiſt Inhabitants; the Lords Juſtices, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell firſt cauſed as many of them ſo harboured in town as could be readily found to be apprehended; and ſecondly, ſought for the reſt, conſidering alſo that in ſo ſudden and great a diſtemper and confuſion, ſomething of extraordinary, was of neceſſity to bee done for terrour to diſperſe thoſe multitudes, ſo to rid the Town of them, and to reſettle in ſome degree the mindes of the terrifyed and diſtracted inhabitants; which the Lords Juſtices, and Councell, did chuſe rather to do the ſame by ſome ſharpe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, then by falling upon them by violence, which muſt needs have increaſed the tumult, and therefore the Lords Juſtices, and Councell, did then inſtantly publiſh a Proclamation in your Majeſties Name, Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all perſons not dwellers in the City or Suburbs, to depart within one houre after publiſhing by Proclamation, and that upon paine of death; This Proclamation did not ſo much as intend or aime at any known In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the <hi>Pale,</hi> or Countries adjacent, or any of known credit or good ſubſiſtence, neither did any ſuch qualified perſons then take the leaſt ill apprehenſion thereat, but ſuch of them as applyed themſelves to the Lords Juſtices, were friendly entertained; on the 28 of the ſame <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> it being complained to the Lords Juſtices and Councell, by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the City, that many like formerly qualifyed perſons, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly aſſembled to the terrour of the City, did ſtill reſort to the City and Suburbs, and others (notwithſtanding the former Proclamation) did ſtill lurk there, whoſe company they much feared, as threatning ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den violence.</p>
                     <p>The Lords Juſtices and Councell therefore on the ſame grounds as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, did the ſecond time by Proclamation command all ſuch to depart forthwith on pain of death, and the like pain to ſuch as wilfully harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them; And that the Inhabitants ſhould forthwith bring in the names of all ſuch ſtrangers, and the Officers to apprehend ſuch Inhabitants as ſhould further harbour them: which no way was intended towards men of quality, or known credit as aforeſaid, neither did any of them ſtirre, or take any miſapprehenſion at it: afterwards on the 11 of <hi>November</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the Lords Juſtices and Councell having intelligence from ſeverall parts, of the inſolent proceeding of the Rebels, againſt the Britiſh and Proteſtants, in the borders of the Pale, (The Lords Juſtices and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell then not fearing diſloyalty in the prime Inhabitants thereof) as in ſome other Counties adjacent, and finding that divers men of quality and countenance in the Countrey, and very many others, were then come into the City, whereby the Countrey was deprived of defence, and left o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:159183:46"/>to the rapine of the Rebels then in Armes; And conſidering that in the beginning of ſo great diſtractions, as then began to ſhew themſelves in many parts, the inferiours might bee terrified, or diſturbed in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the prime men, the Lords Juſtices and Councell therefore then, unanimouſly thought it neceſſary, and ſo did (for thoſe reaſons only, and in duty to their then preſent charge under your Majeſty) on the ſaid ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of <hi>November,</hi> Proclaime, and Command, on paines in the ſaid Proclamation mentioned, That all perſons not having neceſſary cauſe of reſiding in the ſaid City, and the Suburbs thereof, or in places within two miles about the ſame (their ſaid cauſe of reſiding to bee approved of by the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and <hi>Oſſory,</hi> then your Majeſties Lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Army and the Councell of warre, there for the time being, or ſuch other perſons as ſhould bee by them appointed, for examination thereof) ſhould within foure and twenty houres after publication of that Proclamation, repaire to their ſeverall dwellings, in which Proclamation there are other Cautions, Preſcripts, and reſervations, which ſhew that no unfitting rigour was offered, or ſo much as intended. This Act of the Lords Juſtices, and Councell, did ſoon after appeare to agree with your Majeſties Royall ſenſe of that neceſſary retyring of ſuch kind of men, in that time of danger and trouble in the Countrey, expreſſed in your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Letters, written to the Lords Juſtices in <hi>December</hi> after, concerning the proroguing of the Parliament; notwithſtanding this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch of the Parliament as were come to the Towne, and their retinues, and great numbers of others did continue in Towne many dayes after, and thoſe of them that were Members of Parliament did ſit, and many of the reſt of the Lords and Gentry did remain in Town, as their occaſions moved them, and did come and go at their pleaſure, neither was there inforcement, or ſo much as menaces uſed to any man, that did not willingly go, or ſaw not good reaſon, on the ſaid Publique warning to depart for the good of the Country and ſafety of their families and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                     <p>And it is obſerveable, that although that Proclamation did expreſſely provide for ſuch to ſtay as having cauſe, and making the ſame known, would deſire to ſtay, yet thoſe of them that had a mind to joyn with the Rebels and did joyn with them, did chuſe rather to depart, then to make uſe of the Liberty given them to ſtay, and yet now would ſeem to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to depart, which ſhews apparently the vanity and untruth of that their ſubterfuge: and ſeeing the unnaturall conſpiracy ſtands ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, as now it doth; it may not bee forgotten that within the ſpace of five weekes after ſeverall Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale,</hi> who had ſojourned in Town, and intended ſo to doe that Winter, and ſome of them who had been dwelling in the City, (no way concerned by that Proclamation) and likewiſe ſome Citizens of good ſubſtance, as is above-mentioned, did free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depart the City with ſome of their ſubſtance of value, doubting the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den aſſault and taking of the City, which ſeemed to bee upon underhand
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:159183:46"/>intelligence, betweene them and thoſe of the <hi>Paſe,</hi> then beginning to ſhew their formerly ſecret Confederacy, till the diſcovery, whereof none of them had impediment or interruption by the Lords Juſtices and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, or any command from them, to come and goe at their pleaſure, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any pillaging all that while heard of in the City, or of any of theſe Gentry in the Countrey. It is moſt untrue, that after the ſaid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery (which was fully made immediately after the before mentioned rebellious Aſſembly at <hi>Swords</hi>) any of thoſe that formerly departed out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> or any others of quality, in the <hi>Pale</hi> (except a few that continued loyall, who from time to time reſorted to the Lords Juſtices and Councel, and were gladly entertained by them) did offer to returne, untill the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne forces, and the forces of the Pale were beaten from <hi>Drogbeda,</hi> and your Majeſties Armies become full Maſters of the field in all the parts of the <hi>Pale,</hi> and then the Lords Juſtices and Councell could not with their duty deale otherwiſe with them, then as is before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Another Proclamation was publiſhed on the 28 of <hi>December,</hi> 1641. requiring all perſons (other then ſuch as had neceſſary cauſes to <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſuch as the Lords Juſtices, or the ſaid Lievtenant Generall of the Army, or the Governours of your Majeſties forces in the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> ſhould approve, and other then ſuch as ſhould bring proviſion to the City to be ſold) ſhould forbeare comming to the City or Suburbs thereof; This was done in time of high neceſſity. The Lords Juſtices, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſeeing that none offered themſelves to them openly, but hearing that divers, being now diſcovered Traitors, preſuming on friends within did ſecretly come to the City, partly to furniſh themſelves, partly to eat up and exhauſt our victuals, and partly to gaine intelligence, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in what caſe the City ſtood, which had been a moſt unwiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull thing in the Lords Juſtices and Councel to permit, yet could it not be totally prevented, notwithſtanding all their care &amp; diligence; ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence had they amongſt the Papiſt Inhabitants of the City. It is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true that any of thoſe mens goods, who firſt departed the City, intended in this Article, or any other mans goods were pillaged, ſeized or confiſcated, by warrant, command, or direction of the Lords Juſtices, neither were any mans goods ſo much as touched or laid hands upon, till a good time after the Lords, Gentry and Inhabitants of the Pale, and other Counties were publikely declared Rebels: Indeed afterwards the ſouldiers which came out of <hi>England,</hi> in times when they wanted pay did many unruly acts by pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and otherwayes; But the Lords Juſtices, and Councell did labour to reſtraine ſuch acts as much as poſſibly they could, which may well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their ſeverall Warrants and Proclamations againſt pillaging, and all other unwarranted violence, wherein they adventured ſo farre as to trench on the martiall part of government, rather then (ſo much as might any wayes lie in their power to prevent it) to ſuffer ſuch diſordered acts to be done, and which were declared to them would (and ſo did indeed) prove to be prejudiciall to themſelves to have ſuch lawleſſe conſumption made of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:159183:47"/>of thoſe things, which well ordered &amp; taken from ſuch perſons, who had juſtly merited it, and orderly Warrants given for it, would long afford them ſubſiſtence, which reſtraint though it wrought little, yet procured great diſlike in the Army to the Lords Juſtices, touching the Calumny of pillaging and burning the houſes of perſons of ranke and quality, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Lords Juſtices, who kept their houſes and annoyed no body, and of others, having the protection of the State; It is moſt falſe that any ſuch thing was done by the command or privity of the Lords Juſtices and Councell, neither (without the Councell) did the Lords Juſtices doe any manner of thing concerning the government; neither can it be conceived reaſonable, that the Lords Juſtices and Councell ſhould be anſwerable for the irregular acts of ſo unbridled and ill-paid an Army, who in thoſe neceſſitous and extreamly diſordered times would not be puniſhed; Though the Confederates have no cauſe to complaine of their loſſes, it being but juſt vengeance on their wilfull and unprovo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked rebellion: and for perſons of ranke or quality employed, no ſuch perſons ever offered themſelves, or were imployed by the Lords Juſtices, and Councell, except two of the County of <hi>Meath,</hi> who after they had joyned with the Northerne Rebels, wrote to the Lords Juſtices, that if they might have Commiſſion to parly with the Rebels, they hoped to doe ſome good, for the quiet of the Countrey, which Commiſſion the Lords Juſtices and Councell gave them; Although it after appeared, that it was ſought by them, onely to gaine ſome colour of ſecurity, for thoſe perſons rebellious complying with the Rebels: However the Lords Juſtices, and Councell, ſent them Commiſſion as is before mentioned, being deſirous to leave no meanes unaſſayed, that might give hope of any ceaſing of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, being then in very weake caſe to uſe that juſt force that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to compell obedience, the Britiſh and Proteſtants being generally robbed and ſpoyled, as is before mentioned, and the City daily threatned, as well by thoſe of the <hi>Pale,</hi> as other Rebels. To this Commiſſion thoſe men ſoone after made a very frivolous and ſcornfull returne, and indeed dealt moſt deceitfully in all things with the Lords Juſtices and Councell, ſeeming by letters to give them intelligence, which were no other, then either terrour and threatning of the Rebels, or publike Acts which they knew would come to their knowledge otherwiſe from the common fame, which will appeare in their Letters yet extant; yet were neither of theſe mens houſes burnt at all, neither were their goods taken by any direction, or command of the Lords Juſtices; But being open Rebels, as the reſt of that Countrey were, when your Majeſties forces were of ſome ſtrength, and when it was thought fit by the Lords Juſtices and Councell, and Commanders of the Army, to burne and ſpoyle that Countrey, to the end to diſappoint the Rebels, and ſend them further off; the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent abroad, ſpoyled them, as it ſeemes, amongſt the reſt, and indeed burnt many other houſes where the Rebels were releeved and harboured, and from whence they had opportunity daily to take Cattle (by ſudden
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:159183:47"/>Roads) from the lands of <hi>Dublin,</hi> having ſpoyled and robbed all the Britiſh and Proteſtants round about it: And touching protected men, the Lords Juſtices and Councell gave very few Protections, finding by ancient and late experience, that courſe to turne onely to your Majeſties diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: It is true, that while the Natives inhabiting within few miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> were permitted by the Rebels to live on their holdings, from whom the active Rebels had daily reliefe,</p>
                     <p>The Governour of <hi>Dublin</hi> gave paſſes to very many of them to bring corn and other Victualls to <hi>Dublin,</hi> for reliefe of the Towne, and ſo did the Captaines and Commanders of other Gariſons of purpoſe to draw to the Market, what they could from the Rebels, which all (out of their Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and their Limits) then were either in act, or full conſent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, yet were none of thoſe people pillaged or ſpoiled by any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Lords Juſtices, and Councell, but all ſuch things reſiſted by them, as farre as they could poſſibly do againſt an unpaid Army; neither did the Lords Juſtices, and Councell ever give direction, or any permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to violate any word or writing of ſafety, given by them, or any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, or ſuffer it to be done, whereſoever they could withſtand it. But after long forbearance of thoſe wicked and evill diſpoſed people, and it being found by daily experience, that under pretext of relieving the City, they carried Munition and other proviſions out to the Rebells, and much more relieved them then the City; and by that meanes gave the Rebells much more ready way to annoy and rob the City: and that ſome ſeeming to labour at the Plow, had their weapons hidden neare them, and if any of the ſtragling Souldiers, or other Britiſh, or Proteſtants, ventured to paſſe by them, ſingle, or in weake parties, they aſſaulted and murthered them; and that from thoſe parts, the Lords Juſtices and Councell, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Commander of the Army, could not at any time receive any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to diſcover where the Rebells haunted, or reſted, though they dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lived and paſſed among them; Then were the Lords Juſtices and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell neceſſitated, to diſanull and revoke all thoſe paſſes, and pretended pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections: and yet that was not done, but upon a fore-warning and time given, and that by publike Proclamation. And afterwards were the Army ſent out (though with the great griefe of the Lords Juſtices and Councell) to burne and ſpoile thoſe parts, which they well foreſaw, muſt conclude in their own great diſtreſſe, as after it did, for want of promiſed proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of this Kingdom; of all which their proceedings they from time to time advertiſed your Majeſty by their letters to the then Lord Lieutenant, &amp; your Majeſties Secretary: Neither was any quarter though ſomtimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably given ever violated by the Lords Juſtices and Councel, or with their privity; neither was any man killed, or his goods taken by any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, becauſe an Iriſh man, or a Roman Catholique, but becauſe a wilfull Rebell: And indeed thoſe diſorderly pillagings lighted ſomtimes aſwell on the Britiſh and Proteſtants, and ſome Romane Catholique In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the City and Suburbs, as upon the open Rebells: As to the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:159183:48"/>Cities and Townes of <hi>Dublin, Drogheda,</hi> and the reſt which were kept by your Majeſties Gariſons. It is true, they indured the trouble of unruly Souldiers, much againſt the hearts of the Lords Juſtices and Councell, but all their miſeries, and the miſeries of all other good men happened by occaſion onely of the hatefull Conſpiracy, and violent Rebellion of the Confederates, becauſe they were under the Engliſh Government: The Confederates did uſe them worſe, then the Egyptians did the Iſraelites, for they tooke away but the Straw, whereas theſe Confederates (beſides the Innocent blood they have ſpilt) did not onely actually rob and ſpoile of their ſubſtance, them aſwell Papiſts of the Cities, as Proteſtants in the Country, where they were able, but alſo, which was worſe, having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into their hands by way of truſt, very great quantities of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, partly in fore-knowledge of this Rebellion, and partly to anſwer their barbarous laviſh expences, they by their Rebellion deprived them of it all, to the utter ruine of many of them, they not ſo much as (ſince the Ceſſation) yeelding them any reliefe, in their ſimilate Councells, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, though free Commerce granted.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, as to the murthers, breaches of publike faith and quarter, deſtruction and deſolation in eighteen moneths (which by computation muſt be after the Conſpiracy and actuall Rebellion fully diſcovered, and your Majeſties Armies ſent over) The aſſertion is moſt falſe and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in all the parts thereof; For whatſoever killing or deſtruction was then executed on the Confederates and their Complices, having their Swords in their hands, in a moſt diſloyall and irreligious action, was done in naturall defence, and in a courſe of juſt Warre, as a neceſſary chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from a Gracious and Religious Prince, upon the unnaturalneſſe of unfaithfull Rebells,<note place="margin">After the Siege of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> of the <hi>Pale</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced into <hi>Vlſter,</hi> they did vaunt that they had killed more Engliſh and Proteſtants in <hi>Fingall,</hi> then were killed in many other Counties.</note> raging in all extremity againſt the Lives, Perſons, and Eſtates of your innocent and obedient Subjects, neither did all that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſtruction amount to the tenth part of the murthers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, in neere foure moneths before, committed upon your Majeſties Loyall and innocent Subjects, and that by ſudden ſurpriſall in open peace and cold blood, when they were no way able to make reſiſtance, as is too apparent: But nothing could reliſh with the Confederates, as favouring of equity, except the Lords Juſtices and Councell would, in baſe feare, have treacherouſly delivered up to them your Majeſties Prerogatives, Rights, and Soveraignty, their owne lives (for their ſubſtance and eſtates, they had before violently torne from them) and the lives of all the remaining wretched Britiſh and Proteſtants; the lives of many thouſands of the ſame kind of men, and the whole ſubſtance of them, and the reſt, being not ſufficient to ſatiate the malice of the Confederates, againſt their lives, their thirſt after their eſtates, and their hatred to the Proteſtant Religion, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Nation, and Engliſh Government. And the indiſpoſition of the Lords Juſtices to ſhed blood appeared in that above ſixty perſons, who amongſt many hundreds came to ſurprize <hi>Dublin,</hi> were on the 23 of October, 1641. apprehended, none ſuffered death, fave one of <hi>Fermanagh,</hi> who as the

                        </note> that one main foundation of their Rebellion, is their hatred of all Law and good order; They cannot indure that the Parliament ſhould ſit, which is your Majeſties higheſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to your people, for the common good: Or that the Courts of Juſtice ſhould ſit, according to the ancient and laudable Laws of the Kingdom, by the benefit whereof they had for ſo many yeeres undeniably proſpered, and advanced into that happy eſtate, which none of their anceſtors ever ſaw, in that Kingdome, many of them innobled, and all of them inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as doth well appeare in the Statute 11 <hi>Jacobi Cap.</hi> 1. But of all things it is and will bee for ever admirable, that they ſhould challenge intereſt in the fundamentall Laws, which they have laboured by all their power and policy to pluck up by the rootes; And with a high hand have executed all manner of violations of thoſe Laws, both againſt Prince and people, as doth well appeare in the forementioned Collections truely made, and by a publique Declaration of both Houſes of Parliament, made the 17 of <hi>November</hi> 1641.

And whereas they affect to vilify the members of the Parliament, doubtleſſe they cannot but know that the Peeres are the ſame they were, when they were thought worthy to ſit with them; And for the Commons, they are for the moſt part the ſame that ſate with them, while they could bee capable of ſo honourable a truſt, and were as active and able in the Service of your Majeſty and Commonwealth as any of them, much more faithfull: And for ſuch of theſe confederates as the wholeſome Laws of the Land have caſt out for their treaſons and breach of Faith, both to God and man, there are by due order and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſubſtituted in their places, men of Eſtate, for the moſt part, but all honeſt and legall men: They ſpeake much in ſome of their Printes, of the Power and Priviledge of Parliament.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:159183:49"/>unto it; Certainly, it is wonderfull, that thoſe confederates ſhould imagine, that by the higheſt treaſons, murthers, robberies, faith-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, betraying their peaceable Neighbours, and Friends, and utterly ſpoyling the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation and Proteſtants in that Kingdome, of their whole Eſtates, they ſhould gain priviledge to ſpeak evill of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Authority, and to bee thought the onely good Governours of the Commonwealth, miſerably diſtracted by themſelves, and that not upon particular quarrels, or pretended grievances, which your Majeſty could eaſily have redreſſed, whatſoever they could bee; but upon prepenſed reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and deſigne to extirpate all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and Proteſtants.</p>
                     <p>If theſe bee the Liberties that they fight for, doubtleſſe they are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyable by the Laws of God or Man, but utterly inconſiſtent with the loyalty of Subjects to a Religious Monarch, now by the mercy of God granted to that Nation; They complaine of perſons impeached in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to bee diſmiſſed by the Parliament now ſitting; This wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to bee a juſt act, they having fully anſwered their charge, and no crime appearing againſt them: And it is upon good reaſon believed, that the ſame was ſet on foote againſt thoſe impeached Judges, rather out of diſ-affection to the Government, and becauſe they were obſerved carefull Servants to your Majeſty, then out of any crime that could bee truely objected and proved againſt them. It is confeſſed that the Parliament, ſince the beginning of that Rebellion have made divers Orders, and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the advancement of your Majeſties Service and the Publick good, and declaration of the Truth; and if there had been any Acts ready, which might have been good for the Kingdome, they might have beene paſſed with as much authority, as at any other time: neither can it appeare that ever the Proteſtants did, or ever offered to paſſe any Acts prejudiciall to your Majeſty, or harmefull to the Nation, wherein themſelves by Gods Providence were incorporated, both in habitation, alliance, and intereſt; Nay, rather their ill requited love to the Nation will appeare in that (as is before herein ſet down) they freely joyned as well in this Parliament, as in the laſt Parliament, and in that held in the Reigne of the bleſſed King <hi>James,</hi> to repeale all Acts that were offenſive, or penall to the Nation. It is confeſſed that ſince the beginning of <hi>Hillary</hi> Terme, 1641. Termes have been kept in <hi>Dublin,</hi> as legally and juſtly they ought to bee, and in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> many known Traytors and Rebels have been upon juſt and full evidence indicted, and many outlawed by a legall and due courſe, but no known faithfull Subjects were then indicted, nor ever intended to bee, neither were any Sheriffes appointed, but men of known-credit, and ſubſiſtence, competent for ſuch a truſt, as now the State of the Kingdome ſtandeth, moſt of the Sheriffes formerly appointed, having openly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the conſpiracy, and action of rebellion againſt your Majeſty, your Government and Laws. And where theſe Remonſtrants ſeeme offended, that Souldiers are members of the Parliament, and have been Jurors on thoſe indictments, and ſome tryals, They ſhould have conſidered, that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:159183:49"/>their Rebellion forced many of thoſe men to forſake their Eſtates, and undergoe that honourable profeſſion, to ſtand in your Majeſties juſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell againſt the Remonſtrants, and to defend the reſidue of your Majeſties diſtreſſed Subjects, and the Government and Laws of the Kingdom: Thoſe Confederates well knowing, that many of thoſe men had, and yet have full intereſts in as good eſtates as themſelves; and aſwell in point of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as other abilities of education, are as fit as any of them were to bee partakers of the beſt truſt in the Common-wealth. And whereas they ſay that divers who came in upon protection and publick faith, were ſo tryed for their Lives and Eſtates; It is a moſt notorious untruth, and can onely befit the Remonſtrants to averre, but can never gaine credit with any that know <hi>Ireland,</hi> or will duly weigh what is here before truely ſpecified. And for their Proteſtation againſt the Parliament, and the Acts of it, and of other your Majeſties Miniſters, it can be of no better value. And for the Remonſtrants deſire, that your Majeſty would bee graciouſly pleaſed to call a free Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in ſuch convenient time, as your Majeſty in your High Wiſdome ſhall thinke fit, and the urgency of the preſent affaires of that Kingdome doth require; and that the ſaid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament bee held in an indifferent place, ſummoned by, and continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Perſon or Perſons, of Honour and Fortune, of approved faith to your Majeſty, and acceptable to your people there: By this their deſire, your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects doe evidently perceive, that the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants thereby intend the diſſolving of that Parliament which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie hath now ſitting, and which hath on weighty reaſons been continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus long: and how dangerous this may prove to your Majeſtie, and your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, they moſt humbly beſeech your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie in your High Wiſdome to judge.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they being Parties criminous, will gaine the acquitall of their owne ill done actions, and the management of the moſt weighty affaires of the Common-wealth, and wholly exclude your Majeſties Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who with all reall fidelity have ſerved your Majeſty this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: and they ſeeme not willing to have any of your Majeſties Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects amongſt them; aſſuring themſelves that if any thing ſhall bee there propounded to the diſhonour of God, the prejudice of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, or any of your good Subjects there, that your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects will ſtand in oppoſition to their intentions: The Remonſtrants well knowing that by their cruell actions they have either murthered or baniſhed moſt of your Majeſties Freeholders, ſo as no votes are left either in Counties or Corporations, for the electing of your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, by which they intend no other then a Parliament of Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, who we doubt not will take care to vindicate themſelves; And as for thoſe of your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, that theſe Remonſtrants have left undeſtroyed by the Sword, they now deſire to deſtroy, or baniſh them out of that Kingdome by colour of Juſtice; as may appeare by this following Oath, by them generally taken.</p>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:159183:50"/>Parliament is continued before a perſon of honour and fortune; And by the repealing or ſuſpending of <hi>Poyings</hi> Law, it plainly appeares that the Remonſtrants deſire to bereave your Majeſtie of the advice of your Privie Councels, both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not agreeable to reaſon that your Majeſty, who is the head, ſhould not be acquainted with the making of thoſe Lawes which perhaps may bind your Majeſtie and Poſterity, your Prerogatives and Revenues, yea, perhaps alter the whole frame of that your Government.</p>
                     <p>If this Law be ſuſpended, they may repeale the Statute made in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for reſtitution of Juriſdictions of the Crowne, in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, and the aboliſhing the Popes uſurped Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of that Kingdome, and all Lawes which doe concerne the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, or the juriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall, whereby your Majeſty will loſe above the one moyty of your Regall Authority, and God be bereaved of his honour, and all good people be enforced to forſake that Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>It being moſt unreaſonable at this time, for that would make themſelves their owne Judges, and they being the parties criminous, ſhould not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have the power of their owne acquitall in their owne hands, but alſo of the condemnation of your Majeſties Britiſh and Proteſtant Subjects, who perſecuted them for their diſloyalty againſt your Majeſtie.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo dangerous for that the Remonſtrants have erected that Idoll of popular Government; We meane their Councels called the ſupreame Councels, Provinciall Councels, and County Councels, and all other their uſurped judicatures, both by Sea and Land, which if they ſhould ſettle by Parliament, they would thereby give countenance to their paſt actions, and for ever exclude the honourable and juſt Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> which for theſe 400. yeares have governed that people.</p>
                     <p>Alſo your Majeſtie is already intituled to a great part of that Kingdome by Attainder of many of the Remonſtrants in this Rebellion, which by this meanes they will be ſure to deprive your Majeſtie of; And ſo to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Majeſtie to raiſe any yearely Revenue out of their lands, or to make your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects any ſatisfaction for their loſſes thereout.</p>
                     <p>This Statute was held ſo ſacred and inviolable, that notwithſtanding that the Committee from the Parliament made ſuite to your Majeſty that an Act might paſſe for the further explanation of the ſame Statute, which your Majeſty upon mature deliberation did not think fit to give way unto; And for the ſuſpenſion made in the 11 year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> It was with thoſe cautions and reſtrictions, as can neither give expedition to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affaires, or be applyed to theſe times or occaſions.</p>
                     <p>And your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects doe humbly crave leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your Majeſty, that whereas by the late Articles of Ceſſation of Armes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> It was, amongſt other things, agreed, That your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Proteſtant Subjects, and their adherents, ſhould injoy all their ſeverall poſſeſſions and quarters, as they ſtood the 15 of <hi>September</hi> 1643.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:159183:51"/>at twelve of the clocke of the ſaid day, without interruption of the ſaid Confederate Roman Catholickes and their adherents; And that reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution ſhould be made of any things taken after the ſaid time, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the ſaid Articles; yet the ſaid Confederate Roman Catholickes have ſince the ſaid 15 of the ſaid <hi>September,</hi> as well by fraud as by force of Arms, taken from divers of your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, ſeveral holds and places of ſtrength, and divers lands and goods, amounting to a very great value, and refuſe to make reſtitution of the ſame, and have burnt and waſted many places, to the ruine of divers Families, and to the great terrour of your Majeſties ſaid Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
                     <p>And whereas alſo upon the Concluſion of the ſaid Ceſſation, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed by the ſaid Lord Viſcount <hi>Muſkery</hi> and others, on the behalfe of the ſaid Confederate Roman Catholickes, that thirty thouſand pounds ſhould be paid by them at certaine dayes agreed upon, which was intended and declared, ſhould be imployed to the maintenance of your Majeſties Army, then much diſtreſſed for want of meanes, yet nevertheleſſe, although the times are long ſince expired, that the moſt part of the thirty thouſand pounds ſhould have been paid, the far greateſt part thereof is detained, and what was paid was paid ſo unſeaſonably, as that your Majeſties Army that relyed thereupon, have been reduced to very great extremities; and your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects forced to pay taxes and contributions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their reliefe, farre above their ability: which failer of payment by the Remonſtrants, your Majeſties Revenues being in the hands of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Roman Catholikes, neceſſitated the ſouldiers to pillage and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thouſands of your Majeſties good Subjects, to their utter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, in manifeſt breach of their undertakings, and to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice of your Majeſtie.</p>
                     <p>And by theſe former and continued evill actions, knowne untruthes and ſcandalous aſperſions caſt on your Majeſtie, and your Royall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Proteſtant Subjects of that Kingdome, in their ſaid Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, all men may judge that they intend nothing but the abſolute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of your Majeſties <hi>Engliſh</hi> government and Proteſtant Subjects there. All which your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects doe moſt humbly deſire, may be redreſt by your Sacred Majeſtie, for the continuation of your Majeſties <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governours and government in that Kingdome, and for the encouragement of your Majeſties loyall and obedient Proteſtant Subjects.</p>

By reaſon whereof the Proteſtant peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners were neceſſitated to the alteration of their Iuſtructions, as hereafter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>

                     <p>In the fourth is added <hi>(in Doctrine and Diſcipline.)</hi>

                     <p>And about the ſame time the Lord-lieutenant ſent for the Proteſtant Agents and declared unto them, <hi>that it would be for their better reception at Court, that they ſhould prepare their ſeverall Companies under their commands to goe into England to ſerve His Maieſty (Sir Charles Cootes excepted) whoſe command lay in another Province.</hi> And ſoone after Captaine <hi>Parſons</hi> Troope was caſheered becauſe they refuſed to goe into <hi>England.</hi> Captaine <hi>Bridgeway,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Hamiltons</hi> Companies, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers of them refuſed to goe, and that the Lord-lieutenant on his firſt motion promiſed not to impoſe that on them, and that Captaine <hi>Bridgeway</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton</hi> were deſirous that their Companies might remaine there, for their ſuture hopes of ſettlement there, were ordered to goe with their Lieutenants; which was very prejudiciall to the ſaid Agents and ſouldiers, moſt of the Souldiers being Leſſees or under Farmers unto them, and perſons who expected ſatisfacton from the rebels for their loſſes and injuries ſuſtained by them; which courſe was the cauſe as Major <hi>Iones</hi> (another of the ſaid Agents,) declared, that he declined the ſaid imployment.</p>
                     <p>After which Captaine <hi>Ridgeway</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton</hi> were imployed to the Lord Lieutenant, and deſired his Lordſhip that Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> and Captaine <hi>Wil.

                     </p>
                     <p>They received anſwer from his Lordſhip, that he would acquaint the Board therewith.</p>
                     <p>The eighteenth of <hi>March</hi> the Proteſtant Petitioners petitioned the Lord-lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Councell for licence for Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Parſons</hi> to repaire into <hi>England</hi> to joyne with their other Agents, in the behalfe of the Proteſtants, in regard the petition limited the negotiation thereof to three or more of them; and that Major <hi>Iones</hi> had formerly declined the Agency; and that Mr. <hi>Fenton Parſons,</hi> then at <hi>London,</hi> was not acquainted with the choice of him made, therefore it was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whether he could attend the ſame or no.

                     <p>To the ſecond, that the propoſitions were agreeable to the Inſtructions given to the ſaid Agents by the proteſtants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and conduced to the well ſettlement of that Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>To the third, that they had no thought to draw prejudice on His Majeſty, or their Lordſhips by putting in thoſe propoſitions, neither had they ſo ſoone put in propoſitions, had not his Majeſty by his Anſwer to the Proteſtant petition directed the ſame.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth, the ſaid Agents humbly conceived that they were imployed to make proofe of the effect of the proteſtants Petition, to manifeſt the inhumane Cruelties of the Rebells, and then to offer ſuch things as they thought fit for the ſecurity of the proteſtants in their Religion, lives, liberties, and fortunes; That the ſaid Proteſtants had no diſaffection to peace, ſo as puniſhment be inflicted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law, as in the propoſitions are expreſſed; and that the ſaid preteſtants might be repaired for their great loſſes out of the eſtates of the rebells, not formerly by any Acts of this preſent Parliament in England otherwiſe diſpoſed of, which the ſaid Agents deſired might be repreſented to his Majeſty, and the Lords of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee accordingly.</p>
                     <p>To the fifth, that the ſaid proteſtant Agents were ſtrangers to his Majeſties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires in England, and conceived that part more proper for the advice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:159183:61"/>then the ſaid Agents, and therefore deſired to be excuſed from medling in the Treaty further then the manifeſting of the truth of the proteſtant petition, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the behalfe of the proteſtants, according to the Inſtructions given them, which the ſaid Agents were ready to preforme, whenſoever they ſhould be admitted thereunto.</p>
                     <p>And having read them before their Lordſhips, &amp;c. Sir <hi>George Radcliff</hi> told <hi>the ſaid Agents, that while they continued ſo high and unreaſonable in their propoſitions they muſt expect nothing but War; To which the Agents anſwered, that they were ill furniſhed for a War, but had rather undergoe the hazard of a War, then conſent to a diſhonorable and deſtructive peace, and they further anſwered that they ſhould betray the truſt repoſed in them by the Proteſtants of</hi> Ireland, <hi>if they did admit of any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alterations of the ſaid propoſitions then, as is hereafter mentioned, which the ſaid Agents were reſolved upon no terms to doe; Then Sir</hi> George Radcliffe <hi>ſaid that he was ſure that if the ſaid Agents would fall three parts of foure of the ſaid Propoſitions, that the fourth part would not be conſented unto; And afterwards Sir</hi> George Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clieffe <hi>(ſeeing he could no way further prevaile with the ſaid Agents to alter their propoſitions) told them that they were ſent over by the Proteſtants of</hi> Ireland <hi>to preſerve them,</hi>

And there may be ſome Orders or Ordinances which may concerne particular perſons in their lives, liberties, or fortunes, that may ſuffer unheard by the admitting of ſo generall a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which is meerly propoſed, as we humbly conceive, to put a ſcorne on your Majeſties Parliament now ſitting there, and to diſcourage your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects who have faithfully ſerved your Majeſty in that Parliament.</p>
                     <q>4. Propoſition: <hi>That all Indictments, Attainders, Outlaries, in the Kings Bench or elſewhere ſince the ſaid ſeventh day of Auguſt</hi> 1641. <hi>and all Leters Patents, Grants, Leaſes, Cuſtod, Bends, Recognizances, and all other Records, Act or Acts depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, or in prejudice of the ſaid Catholiques, or any of them, be taken off the file, annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and declared voyd firſt by your Majeſties Proclamation, and after by Act to be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a free Parliament.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This we conceive to be a very bold Propoſition, not warranted, as we alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by any example, and tending to introduce an ill preſident in after times, for it was never ſeene that Records were taken off the file, but where there was ſome corruption, or fraud, or ſome illegall or unjuſt carriage uſed in and concerning the procuring or making up of ſuch Records, and the ſame firſt well proved upon due examination. And it may not onely conceale, but in ſome ſort ſeeme to juſtifie their abominable treaſons, murthers, cruelties, maſſacres, and plunders, acted againſt your Majeſties Perſon, Crowne and Dignity, upon the perſons of your Majeſties moſt loyall proteſtant Subjects in that Kingdome, and encourage the papiſts there to doe the like againe; beſides the diſcouragement it may beget in your Majeſties Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Subjects to doe their duties in the like inſurrections which may happen hereafter, which alſo may prove very prejudiciall to your Majeſties rights and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, if the Records to ſupport the forfeitures wherein many of them are or may be grounded ſhould be taken off the file and cancelled.</p>
                     <q>5. Propoſition. <hi>That inaſmuch as, under colour of ſuch Outlaries and Attainders, debts due unto the ſaid Catholiques have been granted, levyed, and diſpoſed of: and of the other ſide, that debts due upon the ſaid Catholiques to thoſe of the adverſe party have beene levyed and diſpoſed to publique uſe: That therefore all debts be by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mutually releaſed, or all to ſtand</hi> in ſtatu quo, <hi>notwithſtanding any grant or diſpoſition.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We humbly conceive, that in times of peace and moſt ſetled government, when the courſe of Law and Juſtice is moſt open and beſt obſerved, that the debts due to the Crowne, and actually levied and payd in to your Majeſties uſe ought not to be reſtored, though the Records of the forfeitures ſhould be legally reverſed, which is farre from the preſent caſe; and this propoſition tendeth to croſſe that juſt right of your Majeſty, and to make the diſpoſition by the confederate popiſh Rebels of debts due to Proteſtants, and by the ſaid Rebels by fraud and force levyed and diſpoſed in maintenance of their Rebellion, which cunningly they call by the name of publique uſes, to be in equall degree to the debts owing by the Rebels, and by them all forfeited, and many of them by Law duely levyed, which is a moſt unequall and unjuſt thing; and the ſaid Propoſition cannot nor doth make offer to have the popiſh Confederates cut off from the debts due to them, which they have juſtly forfeited, but onely for a colour of conſideration to have the Proteſtants loſe ſuch debts juſtly due to them as have been unjuſtly taken from them who have done no act at all to forfeit them.</p>
                     <q>6. Propoſition. <hi>That the late Offices taken or found upon feigned or old titles ſince the yeere</hi> 1634. <hi>to entitle your Majeſtie to ſeverall Countreys in Connaught, Thomond, and in the Counties of Typperarie, Limrick, Kilkenny, and Wickloe, be vacated, and taken off the file, and the poſſeſſors ſetled and ſecured in their ancient eſtates by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that the like Act of limitation of your Majeſties titles for the ſecurity of the eſtates of your Subjects in that Kingdom be paſſed in the ſaid Parliament, as was enacted in the</hi> 21 <hi>yeere of His late Majeſties Raigne in this Kingdom.</hi>

Thirdly, the aboliſhing of the evill cuſtomes of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion, Laws, and Government there. Fourthly, the ſatisfaction of your Proteſtant Subjects loſſes in ſome meaſure. Fiftly, the Arrers of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Army, and other debts contracted for that warre, and for preſervation of that Kingdome to your Majeſtie. Sixtly, the bringing in of more <hi>Brittiſh</hi> upon the Plantations. Seventhly, the building of ſome walled Towns, in remote and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate places, for the ſecurity of that Kingdome, and your good Subjects there. Eightly, the taking of the Natives from their former dependencie on their Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who uſurped an abſolute power over them, to the diminution of your Regall Power, and to the oppreſſion of the Inferiours.</p>
                     <q>7. Propoſ. <hi>That all marks of incapacity impoſed upon the Natives of that Kingdome, to purchaſe or acquire Lands, Leaſes, Offices, or Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be taken away by act of Parliament, and the ſame to extend to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Purchaſes, Leaſes, or Grants already made; And that for the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Youth, an Act be paſſed in the next Parliament, for the erecting of one or more Inns of Court, Vniverſities, Frée, and Common Schools.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> This we conceive concerneth ſome of the late Plantations, and no other part of that Kingdome, and that the reſtriction herein mentioned is found to bee of great uſe, eſpecially for the indifferencie of Trialls, ſtrength of the Government, and for Trade, and Traffique; And we humbly conceive, that if other Plantations ſhall not proceed for the ſetling and ſecuring of that Kingdome, and that no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint be made of Papiſts buying, or purchaſing of the Proteſtants out of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Plantations, where they were prudently ſetled, though now caſt out of their eſtates, by the late Rebellion, and unable to Plant the ſame again, for want of meanes, and therefore probably upon eaſie termes will part with their eſtates to the Confederates, that thoſe Plantations will be deſtroyed, to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of your Majeſties ſervice, and endangering of the ſafety of that Kingdome. Touching bearing of Offices, wee humbly conceive that their non-conformity to the Laws and Statutes of that Kingdome, is the onely mark of incapacity impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them; and wee humbly conceive that they ought not to expect to bee more capable there, then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Natives are here in <hi>England,</hi> in like caſe. For Schooles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there are divers ſetled in all parts of that Kingdome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, by the Laws and Statutes of that Realme; And if any perſon well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſhall erect and endow any more Schooles there, at their own charges, ſo that the School-maſter, and ſchollers may be governed according to the Laws, Cuſtoms, and orders of <hi>England,</hi> and the beſt of Free-ſchools here, wee cannot apprehend
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:159183:66"/>any juſt exceptions thereunto: But touching Univerſities, and Inns of Court, we humbly conceive that this part of the Propoſition ſavoureth of ſome deſire to become Independant upon <hi>England,</hi> or to make a ſeparation in the Religion, and Laws of the Kingdome, which can never bee truely happie, but in the good unitie of both, in the true Proteſtant Religion, and in the Laws of <hi>England:</hi> For (as for matter of charge) ſuch of the Natives as are deſirous to breed their ſonnes for learning in Divinity, can bee well contented to ſend them to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie of <hi>Lovain, Doway,</hi> and other Popiſh places in Forraign Kingdomes, And for Civill-law, or Phyſick, to <hi>Padua,</hi> and other places, which draws a great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure yearly out of your Majeſties Dominions, but will ſend few or none of them to <hi>Oxford,</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where they might as cheaply be bred up, and become as learned, which courſe we conceive is holden out of their pride, and diſaffection towards this Kingdome, and the true Religion here profeſſed. And for the Laws of the Land, which are for the Common-law agreeable to <hi>England,</hi> and ſo for the greateſt part of the Statutes, the Innes of Court in <hi>England</hi> are ſufficient, and the Proteſtants came thither without grudging; And it is a means to civilize them after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtomes, to make them familiar and in love with the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Nation, to preſerve the Law in the purity. when the Profeſſours of it ſhall draw from one originall fountain, and ſee the manner of the practiſe of it in the ſame great Channells where his Majeſties Courts of Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> do flow moſt clearly, whereas by ſeparation of the Kingdoms in the places of their principall inſtruction, when their foundations in learning are to be laid, a degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate corruption in Religion, and Juſtice may happily be introduced and ſpread, with much more difficulty to be corrected and reſtrained afterwards by any diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to be uſed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or puniſhments there to be inflicted, for departing from the true grounds of things which are beſt preſerved in unity, when they grow out of the ſame root, then if ſuch Univerſities, and Innes of Court as are propoſed ſhould be granted; All which we humbly ſubmit to your Majeſties moſt pious and prudent confideration and judgement.</p>
                     <q>8. <hi>Propoſ. <hi>That the Offices and places of Command. Honour, Profit, and Truſt within that Kingdome, be conferred upon Romane Catholiques Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in equallity and indifferencis with your Majeſties other Subjects.</hi>
                        </hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We humbly conceive that the Romane Catholique Natives in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> may have the like Offices, and Places, as the Romane Catholiques Natives of <hi>England</hi> here have, and not otherwiſe: Howbeit we conceive that in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity they have not deſerved ſo much by their late Rebellion; Therefore wee ſee not why they ſhould be endowed with any new, or further Capacities, or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges then they have by the Laws, and Statutes now in force in that Kingdome.</p>
                     <q>9. <hi>Propoſ. <hi>That the inſupportable oppreſſion of your Subjects, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Court of Wards, and reſpit of homage be taken away, and a certain Revenew in lieu thereof fetled upon your Majeſtie without diminution of your Majeſties profits.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We know of no oppreſſion by reaſon of the Court of Wards, and we humbly conceive, that the Court of Wards is of great uſe, for theraiſing of your Majeſties Revenews, the preſervation of your Majeſties Tenures, and chiefly the education of the Gentry, in the Proteſtant Religion, and in civility of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:159183:66"/>and good manners, who otherwiſe would be brought up in ignorance and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſme, their eſtates be ruined by their kindred and friends, and continue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie on the chief Lords, to the great prejudice of your Majeſties ſervice, and Proteſtant Subjects: And there being no colour of exception to your Majeſties juſt Title to Wardſhips, we know not why the taking away of your Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame, ſhould be ſo preſſed, unleſſe it bee to prevent the education of the Lords and Gentry, that fall Wards in the Proteſtant Religion: For that part of this Propoſition which concerneth reſpit of Homage, we humbly conceive it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that ſome way may be ſetled for that, if it ſtand with your Majeſties good pleaſure, without prejudice to your Majeſtie, or your Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
                     <q>10. <hi>Propoſ. <hi>That no Lord not eſtated in that Kingdome, or eſtated, and not reſident, ſhall have Vote in the ſaid Parliament by proxie or otherwiſe, and none admitted to the Houſe of Commons, but ſuch as ſhall be eſtated, and reſident within the Kingdome.</hi>

                     <p>Theſe Anſwers to the High and unexpected demands of the confederate Rebels we have framed in humble obedience to your Majeſties directions, but being very ſenſible as of the weight and great importance of the buſineſſe, ſo alſo of our own weakneſſe and want of time, and well knowing that ſome of your Majeſties Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councellours, Judges and Officers of that Kingdome, are now in Town, ſent for over, and here attending by your Majeſties command, who by their long obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and experience of the affairs and ſtate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are better able to give your Majeſty more full and ſatisfactory anſwers touching the premiſſes then we can; and conceiving that the Collections in anſwere to the ſaid confederates Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, which we humbly preſented to your Majeſty the 29. of the laſt Moneth of <hi>April</hi> may in many things give your Majeſtie more light, then theſe our Anſwers do or can: We humbly beſeech your Majeſtie that the ſaid Privy Councellours, Judges, and Officers as occaſion ſhall require may be called upon, and heard, to give your Majeſty the better ſatisfaction in theſe Particulars, and that to the ſame purpoſe the book of the ſaid Collection may be peruſed and conſidered of as your Majeſtie ſhall finde moſt requiſite.</p>
                     <p>After reading of which Propoſitions and Anſwers thereunto; the King asked the Proteſtant Agents, <hi>Whether they had Anſwered unto the Rebels Propoſitions as they were to be granted by him, in Law and Justice, and fit for the ſecurity of the Proteſtants of Ireland, or prudentially as the times were,</hi> Who humbly made anſwere to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, <hi>That they looked upon the Rebels Propoſitions as they appeared to them deſtructive to his Majeſtie, his Laws, Government, and Proteſtant Subjects of Ireland.</hi> Then the Earl of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> ſaid, <hi>That if they asked what by law and Juſtice was due from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, their Anſwers were full;</hi> But now the King expected from the ſaid Agents, What prudentially was fit for his Majeſtie to do, ſeeing the Proteſtants were not in a condition to defend themſelves, <hi>and that the King would not admit the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to joyn with the new Scots, or any other that had taken the Covenant;</hi>

                     <p>The Lord <hi>Digby</hi> upon motion of the Proteſtant Agents for further time to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſaid, <hi>It was good to ſet down thoſe queſtions in writing, and expect their anſwers to them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the King asked them, <hi>What would become of the Proteſtants in Ireland if the Rebels Agents ſhould break off their Treaty, which was to be feared they would do; if they had not their Propoſitions for the moſt part yeelded unto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Proteſtant Agents Anſwered his Majeſty, <hi>That they conceived that the Rebells Agents might be brought to better terms, if they were held unto it; and that they were confidently aſſured before their comming out of Ireland, that the Lord</hi> Muskery <hi>refuſed to come into England with limited Inſtructions, but would be at liberty to do as he ſhould ſee cauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Proteſtants Agents were commanded to with-draw, And ſince that time were no further called upon.</p>
                     <p>And the ſaid Proteſtant Agents knowing by experience how that the ſaid Rebels had in all parts of the Kingdom broken the Articles of Ceſſation, having begun that courſe within 3 days after the ſaid Articles of Ceſſation were publiſhed, by taking away forceably and detaining, (notwithſtanding many complaints thereof made) 369 head of choiſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cows, or there-abouts from the poore Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Suburbs of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and by like proceedings in all parts of the Kingdome, in taking of divers Caſtles, Forts, and Houſes, and great quantities of Corn and Cattle, ſome by force and ſome by fraud, and by burning divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and by with-holding divers contributions in all parts of the Kingdome, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Proteſtant Forces, untill the Ceſſation, to the utter deſtruction of the Proteſtant Party in divers parts of that Kingdome. The ſaid Proteſtant Agents in the concluſion of the Collection which they had made and preſented to his Majeſtie in Anſwer of the ſaid Remonſtrance, did make mention of the ſaid breaches, and alſo of the failers of payment of the far greater part of the 30000. <hi>l.</hi> by them agreed on, to be paid by the Rebels to his Majeſties uſe, upon the concluſion of the ſaid Ceſſation, to be applyed towards the maintenance of the Army there, and alſo of their extream bad and unſeaſonable payment of that ſmall part thereof, which they had paid, in manifeſt breach of their undertaking, the ſaid failers having occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heavie Taxes to be laid upon the poor Proteſtant Inhabitants, and neceſſitated the Souldiers through want to pillage and plunder thouſands of his Majeſties good Subjects. And the ſaid Proteſtant Agents did offer to make proof thereof, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the ſaid confederate Romane Catholiques had broken all the ſaid Articles of Ceſſation, humbly expecting reparation therein, but not hearing any further thereof, and obſerving that the ſaid Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi> and the reſt of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men above-named, which were ſent for out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> had by Authority from the Lord Lieutenant and Councell, informed his Majeſty of 20 ſeverall complaints of notorious breaches made by the ſaid Rebels of the ſaid Articles; whereof no right or reparation could be had there, notwithſtanding many complaints there made. They the ſaid Agents delivered to the ſaid S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Will.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:159183:69"/>and afterwards they underſtood by them that they had acquainted the Lords of the Committee therewith, and that the Lords ſaid that they would acquaint the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of the Rebels therewith; but heard no more thereof: neither were the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Agents ever called to make proof thereof, or of any other their Allegations, or to receive hearing therein. One particular inſtance of a notorious breach of the Articles of Ceſſation, which we produced at <hi>Oxford,</hi> we have here inſerted, being from one of the bloodieſt Rebels, who exerciſed the place of Governour of the County of <hi>Fermanagh.</hi>

                     <p>The 26. of May the Proteſtant Agents ſeeing the Iriſh Agents were gone, waited on Mr. Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and deſired him to know his Majeſties pleaſure and commands, and whether they ſhould expect any further anſwer concerning their Agency from his Majeſtie, And the next day Mr. Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> told them. <hi>That his Majeſty commanded him to know of the Committee for Iriſh affairs; Whether they had any thing more to ſay to the Proteſtant Agents,</hi> And the ſame day Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Nicholas</hi> told the ſaid Agents, <hi>That the Committee ſaw no reaſon to detain them any longer, and that he would move his Majeſty for their diſpatch.</hi>

                     <p>The 30. of May M.

                     <p>By all this which hath been faithfully Related, and ſeverall other Circumſtances, it plainly appears, that the Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi> intentions are and have been for the extirpation of the Proteſtants and Proteſtant Religion, and how far forth they have been countenanced therein.</p>
